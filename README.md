NewsConnect is a web application that allows users to see global connections in news, and makes it easy to find only the news you want to read.

Key features of NewsConnect include:

- Lines connecting points within nations (that represent an article). So if an article has to do with China and India, the two countries will have a connection line. 
- Users can filter articles by category. This would make it easy, for example, to narrow down articles to only economics articles. 
- Users can get a preview of an article by hovering over a map point.
- NewConnect will eventually include a timeline filter so that users can see articles in a particular time range, in addition to a specific category and/or country.
