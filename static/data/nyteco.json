      "text": "APRIL 21, 2015 To that point, the scene could have passed for normal in North Tehran, where increasing numbers of the children of the well-connected live their lives as if the country’s restrictive Islamic laws were written for someone else. Their luxury cars have become symbols of a growing inequality in Iran , where a new class of untouchable one-percenters hoards money, profiting from sanctions and influential relations, leaving Iran’s middle classes to face the full force of the country’s deepening economic woes. Instead of ending the night parking behind the closing gates of an uptown villa, however, the first-time Porsche driver, Parivash Akbarzadeh, 20, lost control of the car, slamming into the curb and hitting a tree. She was killed instantly, and the car’s owner, Mohammad Hossein Rabbani-Shirazi, 21, died hours later of his injuries, the Afkarnews reported on April 23. Not long after, pictures appeared on social media of the wreckage of the sports car, lying mangled in one of Tehran’s most prominent streets. Almost as quickly, the identities of the two victims were revealed: A young, big-eyed beauty and a grandson of a prominent cleric, who, to make matters worse, was engaged to be wed, but not to Ms. Akbarzadeh. In Iran, where the state news media eagerly report on the growing inequality — but always omitting personal details about the wealthy — the crash unleashed a storm of comment on social media, the majority of it very nasty. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Good riddance,” someone wrote on Ms. Akbarzadeh’s Instagram page under a picture of her posing with a ring studded with diamonds in the shape of a dollar sign. “This girl set fire on normal people, now she set fire to herself.” What angered many was not that Ms. Akbarzadeh was in a car with a man about to be wed, though that is illegal under the country’s selectively enforced Islamic laws, which prescribe that unmarried men and women must be segregated. What rankled most was the cocktail of double standards that the crash symbolized, particularly the intertwined issues of rising corruption and inequality. During the tenure of the former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a select few, often well-connected, individuals were catapulted into fabulous wealth after having been granted rights to sell oil, dollars and gold. These “middlemen” started venturing into other businesses, often spreading a culture of corruption, economists and government, officials say. Many of these middlemen continue to sport their three-day revolutionary beards, in a sign of their loyalty to the system. But their children shop in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, for designer clothes, and tool around in expensive cars in a country where prices for everyday goods have tripled or more and many can no longer afford a new car, even locally produced. Continue reading the main story In contrast, the semiofficial Mashregh news website reported in September that nearly 100,000 luxury cars had been imported since 2009, even though the owners have to pay a tax of 140 percent. So a Porsche like the 2015 Boxster GTS that was wrecked in the crash, selling for about $75,000 in the United States, would cost at least $178,000 in Iran, depending on availability. Many of the car owners drive around town picking up girls, in a practice locally called “dor, dor,” the Shahrvand newspaper reported on Wednesday. “The nouveaux riches dress, speak and act differently, in contempt of urban and social rules,” said Nader Karimi Joni, a journalist and activist, explaining the rage sparked by the crash. “They show off their privileged situation and enjoy humiliating others.” Even Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who promotes a pious and sober life, felt compelled to comment on the uproar. “Some young people, highly proud of their wealth, take over the streets with their expensive cars,” he said this week, addressing a meeting with police officials. This, he said, “creates psychological insecurity in the society” and called for action by the police. Ayatollah Khamenei also urged the government to step up efforts to deal with nepotism and fraud. “There is no use in speaking about corruption. Shouting, ‘Thief! Thief!’ does not stop the thieves from stealing,” he said in another speech. “Officials are not newspapers to merely speak about corruption. We should take measures and prevent corruption in its true meaning.” In the past two years, several business tycoons have been arrested, and in 2014, a billionaire named Mahafarid Amir Khosravi was executed after courts found him guilty of embezzlement. Among the thousands of comments on one of Ms. Akbarzadeh’s pictures on Instagram, people criticized her as an “upstart” and an “opportunist,” stressing her origins in the poor neighborhood of Jannatabad. Others defended her, criticizing those making fun of her death. Some said that “unfortunately” the only way for an attractive young woman in Tehran to get married, very expensive in Iran, is to mingle with the sons of the wealthy. Mr. Rabbani-Shirazi was mocked for being the grandchild of an important aide to the founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, but driving a Porsche and, in some of his online pictures, wearing a black cap backward, decorated with silver studs. His family has denied that the car was his, telling the Haft-e Sobh newspaper that Mr. Rabbani-Shirazi did “not even own a bicycle.” They reminded people that the young man’s grandfather also died in a car crash, in 1982, though under far different circumstances: The authorities said he was being chased by terrorists, and have labeled him a martyr, an honorific for those who died defending the cause of the revolution. Nevertheless, for the public the verdict over the grandson and Ms. Akbarzadeh is clear. “Thank God that even when there is no justice in this world in distributing money and wealth, there is justice in death,” one user, Lili.as ayesh22, wrote in an Instagram comment on Monday. “I love God’s justice that rich and young people also die along with the desperate poor people who have no hope in life.” In Amir Abad, a neighborhood where luxury cars are sold at every street corner, often crammed into tiny showrooms, it appeared to business as usual on Wednesday, even though the police have promised to impound the cars of anyone arrested for excessive speeding. “Of course when the leader talks against these cars, it will affect our business,” said Habib Razmandan, a former wrestling champion who said he had been selling cars for years. In his showroom stood Porsches, including a vintage one listed at well over $300,000, and high-end Japanese cars. But not for long. “The children of those with money will keep on buying these cars because they crave attention of others,” he said, adding that the cars are also considered to be a good investment. “When you are rich here, you like to stick out from the crowds, be special.” Loading...",

      "text": " GAZA — Very little of Abu Shadi Shenbari’s family home remains in Beit Hanoun, in the northern Gaza Strip . Only a concrete bathroom wall was left standing when Israeli forces flattened the neighborhood near the border with Israel during the war with Hamas last summer.\nThough Mr. Shenbari had all but abandoned that last panel of erect concrete, in recent days he began building a wood and wire-mesh fort with a flimsy nylon roof to protect the bombed-out bathroom wall, which is now home to a 10-foot tall depiction of a kitten .\nThe spray-painted mural was created by the elusive British graffiti artist Banksy, who slipped in and out of Gaza in February , leaving his mark on three slabs of rubble left from Israel’s 50-day fight with Hamas, the Islamic group that controls Gaza.\nGaza residents, largely preoccupied with the slow pace of reconstruction after a cold and wet winter in this impoverished and isolated Palestinian coastal strip, have been waking up to the value of the Banksy art works that appeared amid the ruins.\nPhoto A depiction of a weeping woman attributed to the graffiti artist Banksy was painted on a door to a house that was destroyed last summer in Beit Hanoun, in the northern Gaza Strip. Credit Mohammed Saber/European Pressphoto Agency “If I had enough money I would buy a glass showcase and put it in there,” Mr. Shenbari said by telephone of the now-celebrated mural. “I would turn it into a museum so that the Americans and people from other countries could come and visit it. For me, it is Palestinian heritage.”\nThat heritage is open to dispute. Last month, another Banksy work in Gaza — an image of a weeping Greek goddess that he had spray-painted on the iron door of another destroyed home — became the subject of a legal contest between the homeowner and an opportunistic Gaza artist. Rabie Darduna, whose home was destroyed save for the iron door, said he did not know that pieces by Banksy had sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars abroad when he agreed to sell his door as scrap to a local Gaza artist, Belal Khaled.\nMr. Khaled paid a mere 700 shekels (about $180), and said he wanted to protect the goddess mural. Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, sent police officers to confiscate the door. Its ownership and value are to be settled in court.\nMr. Shenbari, guardian of the kitten mural, said he had not been aware of the value of Banksy’s works before the furor over the goddess door. He said the basic, chicken coop-like structure he had built around his wall was meant to keep the mural visible while protecting it from people’s touch, and from Hamas, though it is unlikely that some wire and wood would prevent the Gaza authorities from expropriating the wall should they decide to do so.\nContinue reading the main story Interactive Map Assessing the Damage and Destruction in Gaza The damage to Gaza’s infrastructure from the current conflict is already more severe than the destruction caused by either of the last two Gaza wars.\nOPEN Interactive Map “It is private property,” said Mr. Shenbari, who used to live in the one-story, four-room house with 16 other members of his family. “Can anyone come and take the wall of your bathroom?” he asked.\nMr. Shenbari said he watched as Banksy, who has never revealed his identity, created the image of the kitten in about 40 minutes late one morning in February. The kitten appears to be toying with a ball made of coils of metal that Mr. Shenbari said Banksy had collected from the rubble.\nContinue reading the main story Continue reading the main story “Banksy asked us to protect his privacy and we promised our loyalty,” Mr. Shenbari said, adding that his children brought the artist tea and water while he worked. “He told us to let the people of Palestine know that his art is dedicated to them.”\nOn his website , Banksy said he had wanted to highlight the destruction in Gaza by posting photos on his website, “but on the Internet people only look at pictures of kittens.”\nPhoto Another mural in the northern Gaza Strip that was attributed to the British graffiti artist Banksy. Credit Mohammed Saber/European Pressphoto Agency Besides the kitten and the weeping goddess, Banksy painted another mural in Gaza that shows children swinging from an Israeli military watchtower as if it were a carousel.\n“It is a message to Israel and the whole world that Israeli wars in Gaza left nobody safe, including kittens,” Mr. Shenbari said.\nMore than 2,200 Palestinians were killed in Israel’s 50-day war against Hamas last July and August, the majority civilians, according to the United Nations. More than 70 people, most of them soldiers, were killed on the Israeli side.\nRasha Abu Zayed, an artist who owns the Atelier Center for Arts and Education in Gaza City, said that Banksy’s visit to Gaza had caused a stir in the local artistic community, and had even drawn the attention of the Hamas authorities, not generally known as art mavens.\n“The Hamas government does not understand or appreciate art,” Ms. Abu Zayed said. “But look at what they did last month,” she said, referring to the seizure of the painting of the weeping goddess.",

      "text": " KATMANDU, Nepal — Five days had passed since an earthquake devastated Nepal, and rescue teams had largely given up hope of finding anyone else alive among the piles of brick and broken concrete in Katmandu. Then on Thursday, in a part of the city dense with cheap hotels and shops, rescuers turned off a mechanical shovel and — in the relative silence — heard a cry.\nIn the mess lay a 15-year-old hotel worker, Pemba Tamang. A team of rescuers from the United States offered the Nepali crew a camera that was snaked through the debris. It showed the teenager trapped under a metal shutter. A concrete slab was poised above him — held up by a flattened motorcycle.\n“He was trapped in a 2.5 foot tall by 3.5 foot wide area behind the motorcycle,” said Chris Schaff, a battalion chief with the Fairfax County Fire Department from Virginia who was on the American team. “He wasn’t being crushed; he was just pinned.”\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Trying to Locate the Living, Nepal Rescuers Find Only Frustration APRIL 29, 2015 The problem was that the concrete slab was unstable and a threat not only to the teenager, but to the rescuers themselves, since it hung over the area where the men had to dig.\nContinue reading the main story Map Extent of the Damage From the Nepal Earthquake Maps show the landscape of temporary shelters, the epicenter of the earthquake and its aftershocks.\nOPEN Map “It was the most concerned I’ve ever been about people under my command,” Chief Schaff said.\nDespite the dangers, the team, eight Nepali rescuers and two Americans, continued to dig. Residents, who have lived in fear for days as they were battered by aftershocks, rushed to the scene, desperate for good news. The crowd swelled to several hundred, with people lining the roadway and craning for a glimpse from a nearby footbridge.\nDozens of Nepali soldiers also clustered around the site, apparently eager to be part of a proud moment after days of hardship, and amid frustration from citizens who accuse their government of ineptitude.\nContinue reading the main story Video Play Video | 2:49 Searching for Survivors Outside Katmandu Searching for Survivors Outside Katmandu Days after Nepal’s devastating earthquake, rescue teams continued to fly missions from Katmandu to the countryside to find and evacuate the injured.\nBy Rajneesh Bhandari, Mona El-Naggar and Ben Laffin on Publish Date April 29, 2015. The United States rescue team had yet to rescue a single person, so they were intent on freeing Mr. Tamang no matter the dangers, Chief Schaff said.\nWhen Mr. Tamang was finally lifted out, cheers rang out from the throng of onlookers witnessing one of what might be the last rescues in a terrible week. Mr. Tamang’s face was covered in dust and a brace had been placed around his neck. He told rescuers that he had managed to find ghee, or clarified butter, in his tiny enclosure, and it had sustained him. He was then taken to an Israeli field hospital in surprisingly good condition.\nEarlier Thursday, a woman was freed after being trapped next to three dead bodies.\nContinue reading the main story Photographs of Earthquake Devastation in Nepal When Nepal was hit with a powerful earthquake the tremor shattered lives, landmarks and the very landscape of the country. The scope of the disaster in photographs.\nThe rescues were among the rare bits of good news on an otherwise dreary and rainy day during which the enormity of the tragedy that has befallen Nepal continued to sink in. The death toll has already exceeded 5,800, with many more confirmed deaths expected. Although aftershocks continue, the terrible weather seemed to have persuaded an increasing number to leave the tent cities that have been set up throughout the city. Bus service to Nepal’s more remote villages began again Thursday, with the government promising free rides. And domestic flights between some of Nepal’s smaller cities and Katmandu were also resumed.\nGovernment officials announced Thursday the creation of a National Reconstruction Fund to rebuild infrastructure, and the government said that it would pay families almost $1,400 for each person who died as a result of the quake to help defray funeral costs and other expenses. The government’s top tourism official announced that climbs of Mount Everest may resume, if climbers decide to go ahead. Many of the climbers who had hoped to summit Mount Everest have already left, and at least 19 were killed when a massive avalanche triggered by the earthquake swept through the base camp.\nBut the rescues were the news of the day.\nAt a news conference, Bill Berger, who is heading rescue efforts for the United States Agency for International Development, spoke of how extraordinary it was to save people beyond the so-called “golden” hours after a quake when the likelihood of finding survivors are best. That period, he suggested, usually ends after three days.\n“We had a really good day. Actually we had a great day,” he said. “Members of our urban search and rescue team were able to pull a live victim out of a pile, and I think for us and the Nepalis, given us new hope in a dire situation.”",

      "text": " Climate change could drive to extinction as many as one in six animal and plant species , according to a new analysis.\nIn a study published Thursday in the journal Science, Mark Urban, an ecologist at the University of Connecticut, also found that as the planet warms in the future, species will disappear at an accelerating rate.\n“We have the choice,” he said in an interview. “The world can decide where on that curve they want the future Earth to be.”\nAs dire as Dr. Urban’s conclusions are, other experts said the real toll may turn out to be even worse. The number of extinctions “may well be two to three times higher,” said John J. Wiens , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona.\nGlobal warming has raised the planet’s average surface temperature about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the Industrial Revolution. Species are responding by shifting their ranges.\nIn 2003, Camille Parmesan of the University of Texas and Gary Yohe of Wesleyan University analyzed studies of more than 1,700 plant and animal species. They found that, on average, their ranges shifted 3.8 miles per decade toward the planet’s poles.\nIf emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases continue to grow, climate researchers project the world could warm by as much as 8 degrees Fahrenheit. As the climate continues to change, scientists fear, some species won’t be able to find suitable habitats.\nFor example, the American pika, a hamsterlike mammal that lives on mountains in the West, has been retreating to higher elevations in recent decades. Since the 1990s, some pika populations along the species’s southernmost ranges have vanished .\nHundreds of studies published over the past two decades have yielded a wide range of predictions regarding the number of extinctions that will be caused by global warming. Some have predicted few extinctions, while others have predicted that 50 percent of species face oblivion.\nThere are many reasons for the wide variation. Some scientists looked only at plants in the Amazon, while others focused on butterflies in Canada. In some cases, researchers assumed just a couple of degrees of warming, while in others they looked at much hotter scenarios. Because scientists rarely were able to say just how quickly a given species might shift ranges, they sometimes produced a range of estimates.\nMatter Matter.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story A day after the police arrested 143 people in Manhattan during demonstrations against police brutality, New York officials on Thursday defended their aggressive response, saying any escalation on the part of officers was provoked by protesters who sought to cause trouble. The police made the arrests on Wednesday night in an effort to tamp down on early signs of unrest as protesters marched in a show of solidarity with demonstrators in Baltimore angered by the death of Freddie Gray , an unarmed 25-year-old black man who died after being injured while in police custody this month. Two of the protesters were arrested after assaulting officers, Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said. One officer was injured during the demonstrations when he was hit on the chin with a stick, the police said. Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference about the response to the protest: “We won’t tolerate illegality. We won’t tolerate disorder. We will not allow the few to undermine the honest efforts of the many to express their views.” Mr. de Blasio called the right to peaceful protest a “sacred” and “fundamental” American value, emphasizing that the police would continue to try to accommodate demonstrators. But he denied accusations by demonstrators in New York that the quick arrests caught them off guard, and attributed signs of unrest to people who travel the country looking for opportunities to incite officers. “When the police give you an instruction, you follow the instruction — it’s not debatable,” Mr. de Blasio said. “I’m saying this as someone who has been at these protests.” Some protesters on Wednesday night stopped traffic on Houston Street in Lower Manhattan, and others blocked the entrance to the Holland Tunnel. Another group marched uptown to Times Square and Hell’s Kitchen where, later in the night, a police van filled with marchers who had been arrested sat idling in traffic. On Thursday afternoon, about 50 people from various organizations stood in front of Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan to denounce what they called a marked shift toward more aggressive policing of the demonstrations. They said the police gave no warning about their shifting tactics, adding that understanding the rules of engagement was essential for protesters. They also said they felt Mayor de Blasio had let them down. “It’s more of a disappointment that he allowed his N.Y.P.D. to actually enforce that type of aggression onto the protesters,” said Carmen Perez, the co-founder of Justice League NYC, which protested on Wednesday night as an act of solidarity with demonstrators in Baltimore. To her, there was no question that the police tactics were “extremely different” from the department’s approach in December. “They actually agitated a lot of the situations; they did not communicate anything to us,” Ms. Perez said, adding, “If they’re talking about bettering community relationships, they need to have conversations with the community.” Continue reading the main story Police officials pushed back against those claims. Mr. Bratton, speaking at the Police Academy in Queens on Thursday, said the demonstrations the night before “mirrored in a smaller way what occurred back in December,” saying protesters made an effort to shut down at least one tunnel and major traffic arteries. He was referring to the mostly peaceful protests that followed a Staten Island grand jury’s decision not to indict an officer whose chokehold led to the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man. Many people then blocked highways and tunnels, angering city drivers and putting pressure on the police to rein in the protests. Mr. Bratton said the Police Department’s approach to protests, now as then, was to respond to the behavior of the protesters. “So I didn’t see too much different last night than we saw in December,” he said. “But,” he added, “we are going to be much more assertive in dealing with efforts to close down tunnels, close down bridges, and we’ll be much faster to make arrests if in fact they attempt to move in those directions.” He said that officers allowed protesters to be in the street so long as they were not blocking traffic, but that many “stepped over the line that we had created.” The rally began in Union Square at sunset on Wednesday to denounce the death of Mr. Gray and to criticize the tactics of the police in both Baltimore and New York, where the use of force had been a charged issue since the death of Mr. Garner . The protests over the Staten Island grand jury’s decision took a dangerous turn in mid-December, when several people were seen on a bystander’s video taking part in a melee on the Brooklyn Bridge that injured two police lieutenants. A week later, a man in Brooklyn fatally shot two police officers, setting off months of conflict between the mayor and city police unions. On Wednesday night, officers passed out fliers warning the protesters in Union Square that they would be arrested if they blocked traffic. But as night fell, throngs of people spilled into the streets and broke off into smaller groups that snaked through a half-dozen Manhattan neighborhoods as police helicopters hovered overhead. “Freddie Gray, Michael Brown . Shut it down, shut it down,” some of the demonstrators chanted, citing the young, unarmed black man killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. “Baltimore is everywhere.” Some of the people who were arrested were seen being thrown roughly to the ground and handcuffed by the police.

      "title": "Nepal Teenager Is Rescued From Rubble Five Days After Earthquake - New York Times",
      "text": "When Nepal was hit with a powerful earthquake the tremor shattered lives, landmarks and the very landscape of the country. The scope of the disaster in photographs. The rescues were among the rare bits of good news on an otherwise dreary and rainy day during which the enormity of the tragedy that has befallen Nepal continued to sink in. The death toll has already exceeded 5,800, with many more confirmed deaths expected. Although aftershocks continue, the terrible weather seemed to have persuaded an increasing number to leave the tent cities that have been set up throughout the city. Bus service to Nepal’s more remote villages began again Thursday, with the government promising free rides. And domestic flights between some of Nepal’s smaller cities and Katmandu were also resumed. Government officials announced Thursday the creation of a National Reconstruction Fund to rebuild infrastructure, and the government said that it would pay families almost $1,400 for each person who died as a result of the quake to help defray funeral costs and other expenses. The government’s top tourism official announced that climbs of Mount Everest may resume, if climbers decide to go ahead. Many of the climbers who had hoped to summit Mount Everest have already left, and at least 19 were killed when a massive avalanche triggered by the earthquake swept through the base camp. But the rescues were the news of the day. At a news conference, Bill Berger, who is heading rescue efforts for the United States Agency for International Development, spoke of how extraordinary it was to save people beyond the so-called “golden” hours after a quake when the likelihood of finding survivors are best. That period, he suggested, usually ends after three days. “We had a really good day. Actually we had a great day,” he said. “Members of our urban search and rescue team were able to pull a live victim out of a pile, and I think for us and the Nepalis, given us new hope in a dire situation.” \nEllen Barry reported from Katmandu and Gardiner Harris from New Delhi. Chris Buckley and Bhadra Sharma contributed reporting from Katmandu.",

      "text": "Grateful for, and Wary of, Extra Force Grateful for, and Wary of, Extra Force Residents of Baltimore’s downtown areas largely view the influx of State Police and National Guard members positively. But blocks from where Freddie Gray was arrested, residents are much more wary. By A.J. Chavar on Publish Date April 30, 2015. “It’s sort of a retaliatory gesture,” said Robert W. Klotz, a police-procedures expert who lives in Maryland and who is a former deputy chief of police of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. “It’s one of those nebulous type of things where the individual feels they’ve been subjected to it because they’ve been mouthy. The officers say they have no intent in doing anything. It winds up in a he said-she said situation.” It remains unclear what happened to Mr. Gray after his arrest by Baltimore officers on April 12 and whether his injuries occurred while he was being transported. Police officials said Mr. Gray, 25, a black man whose funeral prompted looting and arsons this week, should have received medical treatment at the scene of the arrest. At least two other Baltimore men, Jeffrey Alston and Dondi Johnson, were paralyzed after police van rides in two separate cases that led to lawsuits. Mr. Alston, paralyzed from the neck down, settled for $6 million in 2004 . Civil rights lawyers, former police chiefs and police-procedures experts said it was impossible to know how widespread the rough-riding practice has been throughout the country. Allegations have surfaced over the past three decades in Philadelphia, Aurora, Ill., a Chicago suburb, and elsewhere. In Chicago, the American Civil Liberties Union represented Mr. Franklin in the federal lawsuit that he filed against six police officers, alleging civil rights violations and injuries that required him to undergo two reconstructive surgeries on his mouth. The city settled the case for $135,000. And although the city’s lawyers denied the officers had given Mr. Franklin a rough ride, the case caused Chicago police officials to stop using wagons to transport suspects and use squad cars instead, said Edwin C. Yohnka, a spokesman for the A.C.L.U. of Illinois. The same year Mr. Franklin was injured, another handcuffed man suffered a broken neck after he fell off a bench in the back of a police van after the vehicle made a sharp turn. He won a $900,000 settlement. Loading...",

      "text": "MARCH 26, 2015 Ms. Costa recalled how her father, who died in 1998, suffered from the criticisms that Brasília was a dystopian place, a cautionary tale of architectural hubris, a case study in the failures of top-down planning and pedestrian inconvenience. He watched a city conceived for 500,000 residents yield to the strains of a population several times that size, which gave rise to condominium towers, informal housing and other buildings he had never envisioned. Photo Visitors study a model of the National Art Schools in Havana, Cuba, by the Italian-born architect Vittorio Garatti, who designed these schools with Ricardo Porro and Roberto Gottardi. Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times With care, she pulled a different photograph from her bag. “Latin America in Construction” recalls a not-so-distant time when architects and governments together dreamed big about changing the world for the better. From Cuba to Chile, Mexico to Argentina, cities in the region boomed. The task of providing everybody with homes ultimately proved unmanageable: proliferating slums outpaced new construction; poverty rose. By the 1980s, a pitiless neoliberalism swept aside much of the abiding faith in public largess and its social agenda. Even so, what got built through the 1970s in places like Havana and Buenos Aires, Mexico City and Lima included some of the most inspired architecture of the modern age. The show is an eye-opener, rectifying a long-skewed, Eurocentric worldview, shedding light on a period neglected for generations outside the region. It’s the sort of exhibition MoMA still does best. Photo A middle-class housing complex in Bogotá, Colombia, by Rogelio Salmona (1964-70). Credit Leonardo Finotti That it glides over politics, lumps some nations together and ignores others, like Ecuador and the Dominican Republic, provides fodder for detractors and for reams of future dissertations. It is next to impossible to discern from the show, say, what transpired in Cuba, where the United States’ embargo, Soviet prefabricated concrete-panel housing and Fidel Castro’s regime quashed a short-lived efflorescence of revolutionary architecture. The exhibition nods to an exemplar of that creativity, the National Art Schools in Havana, partly designed by two Italian architects, but it overlooks far less familiar projects, like the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas by Joaquín Galván and the medical campus in Santiago de Cuba by Rodrigo Tascón. Others will make up their own lists of the disappeared. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Such is the nature of the beast with an exhibition like this. Triage is inevitable. The organizers are at least upfront about it. On the plus side, works in the show by the singular and fascinating Brazilian architect Lina Bo Bardi include her glass house and her art museum in São Paulo, with its anything-goes public plaza, and the cultural and sports center SESC Pompéia, a paradigm of multiuse, nonprescriptive urbanism. I was even happier to find a hospital by João Filgueiras Lima, called Lelé, her compatriot, who should be better known. Havens of light, air and soaring space, his clinics are exalted examples of humane design. Continue reading the main story Architects like Bo Bardi and Lelé make the point that Latin Americans didn’t just riff on Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier by adding a few sunshades and carioca curves. While Europe and the United States constructed their share of third-rate apartment blocks and dull glass office towers, Latin America was a locus of ferment. The exhibition’s curator, Barry Bergdoll, briefly contemplated a different title for the show: “When Latin America Was the Future.” Photo A model of the São Paulo Museum of Art by Lina Bo Bardi (1957). Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times Back then, it was. The region during that period was transformed by large-scale, state-sponsored development. A video in the exhibition shows President Kennedy endorsing a resettlement program in Venezuela at the same time a puckish young Mr. Castro extols a new housing project for Cuba. Dictatorship or democracy, left-wing revolutionary or right-wing junta, the exhibition argues, ruling parties across Latin America, and their paymasters in Washington and Moscow, shared what Mr. Bergdoll calls a “poetics of developmentalism.” MoMA last surveyed architecture from the region 60 years ago. The curator then was Henry-Russell Hitchcock. He commissioned a photographer to document some notable buildings from the previous decade and proffered a unified theory of Latin American style. The show naturally extolled Oscar Niemeyer; some private houses and other projects in Latin America became minor shrines to a vague tropical modernism. The approach was formalist and breezy, a colonialist’s snapshot. Photo A church in Atlantida, Uruguay, by Eladio Dieste (1958). Credit Leonardo Finotti “Latin America in Construction” takes another tack. Visitors navigate dense rooms packed with models, drawings, photographs, pamphlets, blueprints, films — a gold mine of original material conveying a cacophony of ideas and belying any single aesthetic. You can shake your head at the variety of projects missing from the 20th-century canon: rural churches by Eladio Dieste, an Uruguayan engineer, which rival Ronchamp; a middle-class housing complex in Bogotá, Colombia, by Rogelio Salmona, melding public and private space; a bank headquarters in Buenos Aires by SEPRA Arquitectos and Clorindo Testa that outmuscles Paul Rudolph and Richard Rogers before the fact; an architecture school in São Paulo by João Batista Vilanova Artigas and Carlos Cascaldi that makes Brutalism look weightless and balletic; a housing development called Previ, in Peru, enlisting global designers to anticipate cutting-edge doctrines about incremental and participatory design. The list goes on. Photo Oscar Niemeyer’s cathedral under construction in Brasília. Credit Arquivo Publico do Distrito Federal Arriving into the second decade of the first urban century in human history, when more people now live in cities than don’t, the show is well timed. Experts today predict that three-quarters of the world’s population will be urban by 2050, a third living in slums, mostly in the so-called global south that includes Latin America. Once again, the region is the future. The exhibition recalls an earlier era when architects there believed that social challenges should be tackled by design, that humane societies deserved beautiful new forms, and progressive development put faith in art, nature and the resilience of ordinary people. Continue reading the main story There isn’t a lot of visionary thinking today. “Latin America in Construction” seems possessed by a bygone optimism. The photograph that Ms. Costa retrieved from her bag was not what I expected. It wasn’t a picture of Brasília pristine, before the criticisms and the changes. Photo Visitors with a model of a bank headquarters in Buenos Aires by SEPRA Arquitectos and Clorindo Testa. Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times It showed a smiling, elderly man sitting in a bar, nursing an espresso. The man was her father. The bar could have been anywhere. “That’s the point,” she told me. Over the decades trees have softened her father’s housing blocks. The capital’s public buildings by Niemeyer still look like Buck Rogers fantasies in an alien landscape, but Brasília, like Washington, was designed to be monumental and its government landmarks were never that much less pedestrian-friendly than those in Washington. The city Lúcio Costa dreamed up in the middle of nowhere has become “a city,” was Ms. Costa’s point, “not a tourist city but a real city” imperfect like any other, where one day its planner could return to enjoy a coffee in an ordinary bar. “My father,” she said, “was a lucky man.” Dreamers often are. \n“Latin America in Construction: Architecture 1955-1980” runs through July 19 at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan; 212-708-9400, moma.org.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story A trio of social media stocks is getting pummeled this week, a signal that Wall Street may be losing patience with some of its Internet darlings. LinkedIn on Thursday plunged as much as 25 percent in after-hours trading after the professional social networking company forecast second-quarter sales that were weaker than Wall Street estimates. The drop followed the declines of two other social networking companies. Twitter shares are down around 25 percent this week after the company reported quarterly sales that fell short of expectations, while local reviews site Yelp plummeted 23 percent on Thursday, one day after it posted disappointing sales. The performances illustrate the way investors are questioning whether social media companies can keep their growth rates vigorous enough to justify their valuations. The stocks of all three companies had traded at relatively high levels, reflecting Wall Street’s giddy projections. Yet all three shattered that perception in their own way. And while many of these stocks are often volatile, with investors on edge about the weak economy, interest rates and other issues, shareholders increasingly have little tolerance for the slightest misstep. “Based on where some of these stocks were trading, expectations were already very high and were priced for relative perfection,” said Colin Sebastian, a senior analyst for Robert W. Baird & Company. “The reaction when companies don’t achieve great results can be fairly severe.” Any continued rockiness in the stocks could cause repercussions. Last year, several technology companies — including the online storage firm Box — delayed their initial public offerings because of turbulence in tech stocks. A protracted swoon in public tech companies could also trickle into their privately held counterparts. These companies have been frothy lately, with start-ups daily hitting $1 billion-plus valuations and renewing talk of a bubble in Silicon Valley. Wall Street analysts are already reassessing their financial forecasts of some of the social media companies. In the last few days, several analysts who track Yelp and Twitter have lowered their expectations of the financial and stock performance of the companies. Not all social media stocks are getting swept up in the maelstrom. Facebook, which posted quarterly results last week , also reported sales that were lighter than Wall Street expected. Yet its stock has withstood the headwinds, as Facebook continues to pull away from competitors by adding users to its main social networking site, as well as its Instagram photo-sharing app and WhatsApp messaging service. The company also is making money off newer lines of business, like video advertising. “With some of the larger platform companies like Facebook and Google, valuation isn’t based so much on stretched growth targets,” Mr. Sebastian said. Unlike many other social media companies, LinkedIn doesn’t depend on online advertising for its performance. On Thursday, the company posted a 35 percent jump in sales for the first quarter, exceeding estimates, with growth from services it sells to recruiters and premium subscriptions. Continue reading the main story But LinkedIn warned that profits for the rest of the year would be hurt by the strong dollar, weak ad sales in Europe and a transition with assigning new accounts in its sales force. In addition, the company has increased research spending, and is grappling with the impact of its $1.5 billion deal to purchase Lynda.com , a video-based education site, its biggest acquisition ever. Some of these “investments required operational transitions that will be impacting our results through the middle of this year, but that we anticipate will position us well for 2016 and beyond,” said Jeffrey Weiner, LinkedIn’s chief executive, in a conference call, where he pointed particularly to the sales force and spending on research and development. Yelp, which collects user reviews about restaurants and other local services, reported late Wednesday that its ad sales and user growth decelerated during the first quarter. The results suggested that it will be more challenging than expected to make money from the millions of people who check its free listings. In a statement on Wednesday, Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp’s chief executive, said the company was continuing to “seek ways to increase engagement and drive awareness” and was confident there remained a “large local advertising market opportunity.” Twitter has had particular difficulty in the last few months persuading marketers to buy ads designed to prompt the viewer to take an action , like downloading an app or buying a product. The company’s inconsistent performance has intensified scrutiny of Dick Costolo, the chief executive, who has vowed to speed up product releases to attract new users and advertisers to Twitter. Robert S. Peck, an Internet analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said in an e-mail that the stock declines this week were company-specific, rather than a reflection of broader investor dissatisfaction with social networking or technology. Amazon.com soared last week after the company disclosed just how powerful a business its cloud computing arm had become. Still, that’s little comfort for the web companies that are taking a beating in the stock market now. Referring to Yelp, Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note earlier this week that “we upgraded shares almost a year ago.” “Our call hasn’t worked,” he said. “And we don’t have confidence that it will from here either.” Loading...

      "text": "APRIL 30, 2014 From the earliest planning stages for President Obama ’s library, Chicago appeared to be the natural front-runner. The Obamas’ have personal ties to the city: Michelle Obama was born and raised on the South Side and often speaks of her devotion to her hometown. Mr. Obama, who has early roots in Hawaii and Indonesia, came to Chicago after college and got his start here as a community organizer and elected official. Martin Nesbitt, an executive in Chicago who is one of Mr. Obama’s best friends, was chosen as the chairman of the Barack Obama Foundation, which is overseeing the creation of the library. Susan Sher, who is leading the University of Chicago ’s bid, is a close friend and former chief of staff for Mrs. Obama. Earlier this year, however, Chicago’s bid appeared to be in danger. Two schools in the city, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago, were competing against each other, a battle that some worried would weaken the city’s overall prospects to land the library. They were competing against Columbia University in New York, where Mr. Obama earned his undergraduate degree, and the University of Hawaii. The University of Chicago had proposed two sites near its campus on the South Side. One is in Washington Park, a 380-acre expanse designed by the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. The other location, Jackson Park, is on the South Side lakefront. It remained uncertain which of the two South Side sites would ultimately be the location. Officials from the University of Chicago had no comment on Thursday evening. Considerable opposition has also come from preservationist groups that have argued that parkland should not be used for a museum. Last week, Illinois state lawmakers aimed to assure that a library could survive legal challenges over the parkland question, swiftly passing legislation that explicitly authorized such construction in the city. Mayor Rahm Emanuel publicly vowed to make Chicago’s bid competitive with New York’s, so that Mr. Obama could choose “his hometown for where his presidential library, in my view, belongs.” When Mr. Emanuel was forced into a mayoral runoff, library officials said they would wait until after the election before they made a decision. Mr. Emanuel won the runoff on April 7. \nJulie Bosman reported from Chicago, and Jonathan Martin from Washington. Loading...",

Success has come quickly for Winston, the youngest player to win the Heisman Trophy, who was also drafted by the Texas Rangers. But he has been dogged by charges that he raped a former Florida State student, who has since filed a civil suit against him. Winston edged out Mariota, who played a more wide-open style of football in Oregon. Tampa Bay, which finished 2-14 last season, has been looking for a quarterback to rejuvenate its franchise.

      "text": "Grateful for, and Wary of, Extra Force Grateful for, and Wary of, Extra Force Residents of Baltimore’s downtown areas largely view the influx of State Police and National Guard members positively. But blocks from where Freddie Gray was arrested, residents are much more wary. By A.J. Chavar on Publish Date April 30, 2015. “It’s sort of a retaliatory gesture,” said Robert W. Klotz, a police-procedures expert who lives in Maryland and who is a former deputy chief of police of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. “It’s one of those nebulous type of things where the individual feels they’ve been subjected to it because they’ve been mouthy. The officers say they have no intent in doing anything. It winds up in a he said-she said situation.” It remains unclear what happened to Mr. Gray after his arrest by Baltimore officers on April 12 and whether his injuries occurred while he was being transported. Police officials said Mr. Gray, 25, a black man whose funeral prompted looting and arsons this week, should have received medical treatment at the scene of the arrest. At least two other Baltimore men, Jeffrey Alston and Dondi Johnson, were paralyzed after police van rides in two separate cases that led to lawsuits. Mr. Alston, paralyzed from the neck down, settled for $6 million in 2004 . Civil rights lawyers, former police chiefs and police-procedures experts said it was impossible to know how widespread the rough-riding practice has been throughout the country. Allegations have surfaced over the past three decades in Philadelphia, Aurora, Ill., a Chicago suburb, and elsewhere. In Chicago, the American Civil Liberties Union represented Mr. Franklin in the federal lawsuit that he filed against six police officers, alleging civil rights violations and injuries that required him to undergo two reconstructive surgeries on his mouth. The city settled the case for $135,000. And although the city’s lawyers denied the officers had given Mr. Franklin a rough ride, the case caused Chicago police officials to stop using wagons to transport suspects and use squad cars instead, said Edwin C. Yohnka, a spokesman for the A.C.L.U. of Illinois. The same year Mr. Franklin was injured, another handcuffed man suffered a broken neck after he fell off a bench in the back of a police van after the vehicle made a sharp turn. He won a $900,000 settlement. Loading...",

      "text": "JAN. 17, 2014 Unlike last year, when a similar bill passed the House overwhelmingly but failed in the Senate, this year’s USA Freedom Act was drafted in delicate negotiations among the House Judiciary Committee, House Intelligence Committee, House Republican leaders and supporters in the Senate. The Senate, now in Republican control, includes four freshmen who supported the bill in the House last year. The act, which expires June 1, is up for its first reauthorization since the revelations about bulk data collection. That impending deadline, coupled with an increase of support among members of both parties, pressure from technology companies and a push from the White House have combined to make changes to the provisions more likely. The overhaul bill passed the Judiciary Committee 25 to 2, uniting the likes of politicians who rarely agree, like Representatives Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, and Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York. An identical measure, by Senators Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, was unveiled Tuesday, a week after Mr. McConnell proposed a blanket five-year extension of the Patriot Act passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Continue reading the main story “I don’t think he’s listening to America,” Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, said of Mr. McConnell. “The seminal question is how much liberty are we going to give up for security? People are on the brink. They’re scared out of their wits.” But Mr. McConnell holds powerful levers as the Senate leader that could halt the momentum or eventually alter the legislation. For the moment, Mr. McConnell and Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and Intelligence Committee chairman, seem to be increasingly isolated. The Snowden disclosures along with data breaches at Sony Pictures, Target and the insurance giant Anthem have unsettled voters and empowered those arguing for greater civil liberties protection in Congress, who a few years ago “could have met in a couple of phone booths,” said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. That has proponents of the metadata collection straining to gain support. “I think people are reacting to a program they don’t know,” Mr. Burr said. Asked about turning back the momentum against him, he conceded, “I’ve got a big task.” Mr. Snowden’s disclosures prompted a public backlash that ultimately convinced President Obama to back an end to that part of the program. But since the president declared an end to “bulk metadata program as it currently exists” in January 2014, little has changed, Intelligence Committee members said. Lawmakers on the Intelligence Committee pushed for changes in the legislation to allow intelligence agents to continue to track suspected foreign terrorists when they enter the United States, even though at that point they are supposed to get a warrant. Agencies could continue their surveillance for 72 hours while they obtain legal authority. The Intelligence Committee also insisted on a new procedure to use the Patriot Act to sweep up data in an emergency, but that information would have to be destroyed if the FISA Court subsequently denies the request. Mostly, though, the committee insisted the bill steer clear of the amendments of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , added in 2008, which legalized warrantless surveillance so long as the target is a noncitizen abroad. The current legislative effort in Congress would not stop surveillance of noncitizens overseas. “I believe that the work of the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee has produced a very good package,” Mr. Boehner said just before the Judiciary Committee vote. The government would still be able to conduct some bulk data collection. The N.S.A. has used a section of the law that created the FISA Court for vast sweeps of phone and email data. Judiciary Committee members from both parties sought to end that data-collection avenue as well, but leaders of the committee beat that effort back, saying the Republican leadership would torpedo the bill if it passed. “If the perfect defeats the good, then bad prevails,” said Representative James Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, an author of the Patriot Act who is now leading efforts to change it. Continue reading the main story Mr. McConnell’s allies are trying to build support. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas who voted for a similar reform bill last year as a House member, met with freshman senators on Thursday to try to sway them to the leader’s side. Along with Mr. Cotton, four other Republican Senate freshmen supported last year’s failed House bill. Besides Mr. Lee, the Senate USA Freedom Act has four other Republican co-sponsors, including Mr. Cruz. Another White House hopeful, Mr. Paul, does not think the reform bill goes far enough. Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said, “After 9/11 I have been a supporter of the Patriot Act.” But he added, “At the end of the day you have to look at what you can craft with the current majority.” A strong bipartisan House vote, expected as early as mid-May, “will send a strong message to the Senate that in the House, both sides of the aisle want reforms,” said Representative Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. Facing a tight deadline, Mr. McConnell is also likely to bring his alternative bill to the Senate floor soon. It is unclear whether he would have the votes for his measure, although it is possible that with a slew of amendments, the Senate could produce a bill on the floor that could be melded with the House version. \nFollow The New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .

      "title": "Social Media Punished as Results Fall Short",
      "text": "APRIL 22, 2015 The performances illustrate the way investors are questioning whether social media companies can keep their growth rates vigorous enough to justify their valuations. The stocks of all three companies had traded at relatively high levels, reflecting Wall Street’s giddy projections. Yet all three shattered that perception in their own way. And while many of these stocks are often volatile, with investors on edge about the weak economy, interest rates and other issues, shareholders increasingly have little tolerance for the slightest misstep. “Based on where some of these stocks were trading, expectations were already very high and were priced for relative perfection,” said Colin Sebastian, a senior analyst for Robert W. Baird & Company. “The reaction when companies don’t achieve great results can be fairly severe.” Any continued rockiness in the stocks could cause repercussions. Last year, several technology companies — including the online storage firm Box — delayed their initial public offerings because of turbulence in tech stocks. A protracted swoon in public tech companies could also trickle into their privately held counterparts. These companies have been frothy lately, with start-ups daily hitting $1 billion-plus valuations and renewing talk of a bubble in Silicon Valley. Wall Street analysts are already reassessing their financial forecasts of some of the social media companies. In the last few days, several analysts who track Yelp and Twitter have lowered their expectations of the financial and stock performance of the companies. Not all social media stocks are getting swept up in the maelstrom. Facebook, which posted quarterly results last week , also reported sales that were lighter than Wall Street expected. Yet its stock withstood the headwinds, as Facebook continues to pull away from competitors by adding users to its main social networking site, as well as its Instagram photo-sharing app and WhatsApp messaging service. The company also is making money off newer lines of business, like video advertising. “With some of the larger platform companies like Facebook and Google, valuation isn’t based so much on stretched growth targets,” Mr. Sebastian said. Unlike many other social media companies, LinkedIn doesn’t depend on online advertising for its performance. On Thursday, the company posted a 35 percent jump in sales for the first quarter, exceeding estimates, with growth from services it sells to recruiters and premium subscriptions. Continue reading the main story But LinkedIn warned that profits for the rest of the year would be hurt by the strong dollar, weak ad sales in Europe and a transition with assigning new accounts in its sales force. In addition, the company has increased research spending, and is grappling with the impact of its $1.5 billion deal to purchase Lynda.com , a video-based education site, its biggest acquisition ever. Some of these “investments required operational transitions that will be impacting our results through the middle of this year, but that we anticipate will position us well for 2016 and beyond,” said Jeffrey Weiner, LinkedIn’s chief executive, in a conference call, where he pointed particularly to the sales force and spending on research and development. Yelp, which collects user reviews about restaurants and other local services, reported late Wednesday that its ad sales and user growth decelerated during the first quarter. The results suggested that it will be more challenging than expected to make money from the millions of people who check its free listings. In a statement on Wednesday, Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp’s chief executive, said the company was continuing to “seek ways to increase engagement and drive awareness” and was confident there remained a “large local advertising market opportunity.” Twitter has had particular difficulty in the last few months persuading marketers to buy ads designed to prompt the viewer to take an action , like downloading an app or buying a product. The company’s inconsistent performance has intensified scrutiny of Dick Costolo, the chief executive, who has vowed to speed up product releases to attract new users and advertisers to Twitter. Robert S. Peck, an Internet analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said in an e-mail that the stock declines this week were company-specific, rather than a reflection of broader investor dissatisfaction with social networking or technology. Amazon.com soared last week after the company disclosed just how powerful a business its cloud computing arm had become. Still, that’s little comfort for the web companies that are taking a beating in the stock market now. Referring to Yelp, Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note earlier this week that “we upgraded shares almost a year ago.” “Our call hasn’t worked,” he said. “And we don’t have confidence that it will from here either.” A version of this article appears in print on May 1, 2015, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Social Media Punished As Results Fall Short .

      "text": " Last June, in the basement of the Microsoft visitor center in Redmond, Wash., Todd Holmdahl, a Microsoft hardware guru, and others nervously walked Satya Nadella, the new chief executive, through a demonstration of a secret project.\nMore than a hundred people had toiled for several years on the ambitious effort, which would eventually be called HoloLens. At the time, the HoloLens headset was a clunky web of straps, wires and electronics. But it was able to project images onto lenses in front of people’s eyes, adding virtual landscapes and objects on top of the view of the natural world.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Microsoft Takes Steps to Close Its App Gap on Mobile Devices APRIL 29, 2015 At Windows 10 Event, Microsoft Jumps Into Augmented Reality With HoloLens Headset JAN. 21, 2015 Microsoft Looks to Windows 10 for a Jolt in the Mobile Realm JAN. 18, 2015 Microsoft, Changing Tack, Makes Office Suite Free on Mobile NOV. 6, 2014 Corner Office: Satya Nadella, Chief of Microsoft, on His New Role FEB. 20, 2014 Microsoft’s Nadella Sets Off a Furor on Women’s Pay OCT. 9, 2014 Microsoft Names New Chief; Gates Becomes Adviser FEB. 4, 2014 The team leaders thought this augmented reality product had the potential to be the next big thing in consumer technology, as groundbreaking as the PC and the smartphone. But this was Microsoft, the company that had managed, time and again, to take ingenious innovation and bungle it on the way to store shelves. Microsoft had its software on smartphones years before Apple released the iPhone. Few cared. A full decade before the Apple Watch, Microsoft introduced its own computer on a wrist. It did not take off.\nPhoto Steven Bathiche, right, a Microsoft researcher who is part of the Surface tablet team, and Flavio Ribeiro, also a researcher. Credit Peter DiCampo for The New York Times The HoloLens team members were confident in their creation. But they worried that Mr. Nadella, a two-decade Microsoft employee then looking at cost-cutting measures and mass layoffs, would kill it for being too risky and far-out.\nMr. Nadella didn’t flinch.\n“He said right away, ‘This is something that we’re going to do,’ ” Mr. Holmdahl said. “We are going to create a new product category, and this is the type of thing that Microsoft should be working on.”\nThat response says a lot about the reshaped Microsoft Mr. Nadella envisions — one with fewer internal fiefs and with more willingness to favor big bets on new technologies over protecting legacy cash cows. Part of that rebuilding occurred at a Microsoft conference that started on Wednesday in San Francisco, where he sought to mend Microsoft’s frayed relationship with software developers, making it easier for them to convert apps written for Apple and Google’s mobile operating systems to run on Windows.\nIn a recent interview, Mr. Nadella, 47, said he and the company had learned from its past mistakes. His Microsoft understands, he says, the discipline needed to build products that look and feel polished. Every part, from hardware to software to online services, must work in harmony.\n“One lesson learned is you’ve got to finish the scenario with excellence,” said Mr. Nadella, who speaks in verbal arpeggios, emphasizing points with octave-leaping sentences. “You just cannot stop. You have to complete this, and I think that’s where Apple has taught us all what experience excellence means in the creation of categories.”\nIn some ways, Microsoft is already a different place from the infamously balkanized one Mr. Nadella inherited from Steven A. Ballmer in February 2014. Not long ago, the company had about a half-dozen internal systems for managing the development of software; Mr. Nadella is pushing everyone to use a single one, in the belief that top-notch internal tools will help it create top-notch products.\nContinue reading the main story He has taken up an effort started under Mr. Ballmer to end the factional strife inside Microsoft, making the 118,000-strong work force nimbler. He has rallied them around mantras, like making personal computing more personal through wearables and other devices. To better translate Microsoft’s innovation into products people want to buy, he has directed the company’s research group, the biggest in the technology industry, to work more closely with product engineers.\nAnd just as important, Mr. Nadella has shown a sense of humility. Mr. Ballmer once laughed at the iPhone in a television interview. Mr. Nadella, in contrast, has aggressively pushed Microsoft’s Office software onto Apple and Android devices — the very devices that have eroded Microsoft’s influence.\n“Their arrogance consumed them,” said Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce.com, a longtime critic of Microsoft whose company reached an agreement to cooperate on software integration with Microsoft last year. “Now with Satya, they have a much more open mind about working with people.”\nStill, given the company’s history, there is plenty of skepticism about whether Mr. Nadella can pull off a hit with HoloLens and other inventive products starting to trickle out of the Microsoft pipeline. Analysts have been impressed with Mr. Nadella’s fast-growing cloud computing business, and the company’s stock, up almost 40 percent since he took over, is hovering near a 15-year high. But he hasn’t yet shown whether Microsoft can deliver an earthshaking new technology.\nAt the meeting about HoloLens, Mr. Nadella told the team how he wanted the project to proceed. It was not going to be organized like Xbox, the company’s video game system, which developed as a semiautonomous republic. He wanted the group to be fully integrated into Microsoft.\nThat meant collaborating with people developing Skype, the company’s online voice and videoconferencing service, as well as the Windows and video games teams. The HoloLens group had already started moving in this direction even before the meeting with Mr. Nadella, but his orders galvanized them. Microsoft says HoloLens will go on sale “in the time frame” when Windows 10, its new operating system, is released this summer.\nIn other words, the HoloLens is only a crucible for the new borderless Microsoft Mr. Nadella is seeking to create. No pressure.\n‘A Decent Batting Average’\nThere is a short list of big technology companies that have staged comebacks that restored them to their former glory. Arguably, that list contains just one name: Apple.\nMicrosoft, which passed the 40th anniversary of its founding in April, is an easy target for critics because its golden era, the 1990s, was eons ago on the digital calendar. For today’s young entrepreneurs and software developers, it’s hard to believe the Microsoft of 2015, defanged by antitrust battles and strategic missteps, once ruled the industry.\nIt’s also easy to overstate Microsoft’s problems. With $22 billion in profit last year, $87 billion in revenue and a cash pile over $95 billion, it often trades places with Google as the second most valuable technology company in the world after Apple. Windows and the Office suite of productivity software continue to print money, especially from corporate customers, despite a spate of premature obituaries. While Mr. Ballmer was harshly criticized for his tin ear on technology, more than a dozen new products released under his watch exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Continue reading the main story Imposing, yes, but Microsoft is rarely named among the future-defining tech companies of today, especially when it comes to the consumer businesses. It is nearly always an afterthought following Amazon, Apple ,Google and Facebook.\nIn the interview in early April, Mr. Nadella argued that Microsoft’s misses should be put in perspective.\nPhoto Steven Bathiche demonstrates PixelSense, his invention that led to Microsoft's Surface tablet. Credit Peter DiCampo for The New York Times “What gets lost is we wouldn’t be who we are and as successful as we have been if we didn’t have a decent batting average,” Mr. Nadella said, sitting on a couch in the same understated and window-lined office once occupied by Mr. Ballmer and, before that, Bill Gates. “I think we would be dead and gone if we were just mostly failing. It’s just that our average in the last five years has not been as great as, let’s say, Apple’s.”\nMr. Nadella pointed in particular to tablet computers. Relying for years on other companies to build all tablets running Windows, he says, led to poor products. Now, the company is heavily advertising the Surface, a tablet that Microsoft designs and builds.\nOf course, it’s one thing to make hardware and another thing to make good hardware.\nAttention to detail, so crucial in today’s hardware market, has not been Microsoft’s strongest suit. When Microsoft first introduced the Surface several years ago, the company did not have a touch-screen-friendly version of its Office applications — the hugely popular programs like Word and PowerPoint — ready to go at the start. It was a bit like trying to sell a car with one wheel missing.\nA similar problem arose last year, shortly after Mr. Nadella became chief executive. The team working on a new version of Surface was frustrated that it took multiple steps — start the device, enter a password, open an app called OneNote — before a user could start taking notes on the tablet with a stylus.\n“By the time you’re done, you probably would have said, ‘I just would have wrote this down on a piece of paper,’ ” said Steven Bathiche, a Microsoft researcher who is now part of the Surface team.\nHardware and software groups were unable to resolve their conflicts, each fearing that changes would throw them off schedule.\nMr. Nadella was not pleased.\n“You’re not going to ship this without making it work,” Mr. Nadella responded at the time. “One of the advantages of being C.E.O. is you say things like that and people rise to the occasion,” he said.\nBy the time the Surface shipped, you could click one button on the stylus to start taking notes.\nTranslating Innovation Into Sales\nA big part of Microsoft’s fate rests with its research arm, the quasi-academic group responsible for conjuring breakthroughs that will keep Microsoft relevant for generations to come.\nOn Monday, Harry Shum, the Microsoft executive vice president who oversees the research operation, was bursting with pride while demonstrating Skype Translator, a new product that incorporates years of work by researchers to convert voice conversations from one language to another in real time.\nContinue reading the main story Mr. Shum gamely agreed to conduct a portion of an interview using Skype Translator. Mr. Shum sat in his office, and I sat in a conference room down the hall looking at Mr. Shum’s face on a computer screen. I asked questions in English, and Mr. Shum responded in Mandarin, his native tongue. He answered a question in Mandarin about the impact he says Skype Translator can have, and the software spit out an English transcript and synthesized recording seconds later.\nThe software made mistakes — Skype transcribed his name as “Hairy” — but it got the point across. “Today we have a lot of obstacles of communication,” Mr. Shum said, according to the Skype translation. “Because we speak a different language, you speak English, I speak Chinese, if we are not able to understand the two sides, the world would have a lot of problems.”\nFounded in 1991 by Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft’s chief technology officer at the time, as an early warning system for disruptive new technologies, Microsoft Research occupies a building that has a spacious, multistory atrium, filled with a swirl of employees in T-shirts, jeans and other timeless fashions of tech.\nIt is the biggest operation of its kind in the technology industry, with more than 1,000 scientists and engineers working in labs as far away as China and Israel. The company’s research-and-development spending last year was $11.4 billion.\nSpending doesn’t guarantee success, however. There is a long history of technology companies fumbling commercial opportunities from research breakthroughs sitting right under their noses. In the 1970s, Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center developed a forerunner of the modern PC, with a graphical user interface and mouse. An outsider who saw it, Steven P. Jobs, was the one who eventually capitalized on the technology with the Apple Macintosh.\nMr. Nadella is trying to avoid missed opportunities. He has pushed researchers and product engineers to work closer than ever before. He invited Mr. Shum to attend a regular Wednesday-afternoon meeting of a small group called the product leadership team; Mr. Shum is the first representative from Microsoft Research to participate in the sessions.\nInside the old Microsoft, the translation technology could easily have languished as a cool demo and nothing more. Product groups would have been slow to embrace an experimental technology that could introduce new costs not to mention uncertainty into their release schedules.\nPhoto Harry Shum, the executive vice president who oversees Microsoft's research operation. Credit Peter DiCampo for The New York Times “Instead of saying, ‘Hey, let’s see what we can do together,’ you’d say, ‘Well, when you cross this level of accuracy, come and talk to me, then we’ll figure out when we can slot you in,’ ” said Gurdeep Singh Pall, the Microsoft corporate vice president in charge of Skype.\nBreaking down barriers at Microsoft is still a work in progress, but some executives said the tone had changed markedly. “Skype had every reason to push back,” said Peter Lee, a corporate vice president at Microsoft Research. “But instead Gurdeep, especially, just embraced this.”\nContinue reading the main story “There’s an eagerness in the business units to pick up ideas that are going to make a significant difference,” said Ed Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, who is on the technical advisory board for Microsoft Research.\nMr. Shum, who worked for years as a top engineer on Bing, a distant No. 2 in the search engine market to Google, has seen Microsoft get burned in new technology markets before.\n“It’s at this very critical moment for the company, and either we build products people love or we will be history,” Mr. Shum said.\nHoloLens, too, is jammed with technologies that started in Microsoft Research, including the display technology used to paint virtual images on lenses in front of people’s eyes. It uses cameras developed by Microsoft researchers and first used in Kinect, an Xbox accessory, to map a person’s surroundings so virtual objects stay where they’re supposed to.\nSlick hardware, though, will go only so far. If HoloLens has any chance of becoming a breakout hit, it will need must-have applications — add-ons that will do for augmented reality what wildly popular services like Instagram and Snapchat have done for smartphones.\nChanging the Game\nAt the Microsoft conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, the company showed examples of how HoloLens will be used. In one, a medical school expects to adopt HoloLens to let students learn anatomy. In another, a building developer plans to have clients explore finished architecture while on a project still in construction.\nThose examples fill nice niches, but they certainly don’t scream mass market. For that, Microsoft is turning partly to games.\nIn September, Microsoft paid $2.5 billion for Minecraft, the video game played by tens of millions of people. By January, the logic behind the purchase started to become a little clearer when the company showed the game on HoloLens.\nIn Minecraft, players can build and destroy structures, sort of like playing virtual Legos. With the HoloLens, the game is no longer confined to a smartphone or a computer screen, though. Players wearing the headset can decorate the surfaces of a room with Minecraft blocks, then destroy them, if they like. In the demonstration Microsoft showed, it was possible to build on a coffee table, then crush it to expose a cave below.\nMr. Nadella said HoloLens was a big reason for buying Minecraft.\n“Let’s have a game that, in fact, will fundamentally help us change new categories,” Mr. Nadella said. “HoloLens was very much in the works then, and we knew it.”\nAt least one thing is certain: Microsoft will have a lot of competition. Magic Leap, a closely watched start-up that Google has invested in, is developing an augmented-reality device. Virtual-reality headsets from Oculus, owned by Facebook, Valve and Sony, which envelop users with virtual environments, are also on the way.\nThere is also little evidence so far that the public is clamoring to don a headpiece and wear it for hours. Google Glass is a cautionary tale. The company has pulled back significantly on its aspirations for that computer-in-your-face product, as least for now.\nContinue reading the main story Continue reading the main story Doubters have already lined up with HoloLens, certain that Microsoft will once again trip over itself. The product looks as if it will be far more expensive than smartphones, which benefit from subsidies from wireless carriers that lower their initial cost. One current Microsoft executive said HoloLens would cost significantly more than a game console, which runs more than $400.\nEven if Mr. Nadella and other top executives have recognized the need for change, there are still pockets of resistance. Rahul Sood, who ran a venture capital fund inside Microsoft until November, praised Mr. Nadella for changing Microsoft, but said there wasn’t enough risk-taking below him.\n“The part making that harder is there is a big layer of middle management,” said Mr. Sood, who founded Unikrn, a start-up based in Seattle that is focused on competitive gaming. “I think it’s slowly changing. I think they need more entrepreneurs in the company.”\nEven Mr. Nadella hints at uncertainty when discussing the kind of impact HoloLens will have.\n“I don’t want to overhype it like Google Glass and say this is the next,” he says, trailing off. “I want us to be deliberate about what it is.”\nAt least with HoloLens, Microsoft appears to be skating to where the puck could be headed in technology, rather than where it has been. Brad Silverberg, a venture capitalist in Seattle and a former senior executive at Microsoft, said he was encouraged that the company was doing that rather than playing catch-up in smartphones.\n“That battle is already fought and lost,” Mr. Silverberg said. “You’ve got to change the game.”\nLoading...

      "text": "Continue reading the main story In recent years, the fast-growing popularity of solar panels has intensified a central challenge: how to use the sun’s energy when it isn’t shining. Now, Tesla Motors, the maker of luxury electric sedans, says it is taking a big step toward meeting that challenge with a fleet of battery systems aimed at homeowners, businesses and utilities. The company’s foray into the solar storage market will include rechargeable lithium-ion battery packs that can mount to a home garage wall as well as battery blocks large enough to smooth out fluctuations in the grid. “We’ve obviously been working on building a world-class battery, a superefficient and affordable way to store energy,” said Khobi Brooklyn, a Tesla spokeswoman. “It’s just that we’ve been putting that battery in cars most of the time.” To herald its ambitions in the field, the company scheduled an event Thursday night at its design studio in Hawthorne, Calif., with Elon Musk, its chief executive, presiding. In a news conference before the event, Mr. Musk said the consumer battery, called the Powerwall, would sell for $3,500, and was derived from the batteries that Tesla uses in its Model S vehicles. The device, which Tesla will start producing later this year, will be installed by licensed technicians. The batteries will be connected to the Internet and can be managed by Tesla from afar. Customers can connect up to nine battery packs to store larger amounts of power. “If you have the Tesla Powerwall, if the utility goes down, you still have power,” Mr. Musk said. He added: “The whole thing is an integrated system that just works.” Energy and auto analysts have generally responded positively to Tesla’s move. “Elon thinks that there’s a long-term gain to be made or a long-term play not only in electric cars but also in electric energy storage — and he’s probably right,” said Karl Brauer, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “There’s a universal application for portable energy and storable energy that goes to everybody. It’s really just a matter of getting the business model together.” Tesla’s announcement comes as energy companies are moving in the same direction. Sungevity, a leading solar installer, announced a partnership this week with Sonnenbatterie, a smart energy storage provider in Europe, to begin offering their systems to its customers. NRG, one of the largest independent power producers in the United States, is also developing storage products. “We have to be in this space,” said Steve McBee, chief executive of NRG Home. “If your goal is to build a meaningful solar business that is durable over time, you have to assume that that solar business is going to morph into a solar-plus-storage solution. That will be mandatory at some point.” Still, the market is young and, some experts say, Tesla has the advantage of reach and scale — as well as a $5 billion battery production plant under construction near Reno, Nev., that it calls the Gigafactory. Continue reading the main story “Tesla’s not the only one doing it, but Tesla can bring it to a wider audience than most other people can,” said Shayle Kann, a vice president at GTM Research, which tracks clean-tech industries. “Once they get the Gigafactory up and going, they will be able to deploy on a scale that no one will quite be able to rival. So they may have a cost advantage in that.” Tesla has been refining its storage business for a few years, working with a number of companies including Jackson Family Wines, the electric utility Southern California Edison and the installation company SolarCity, of which Mr. Musk is chairman and whose founders, Lyndon and Peter Rive, are his cousins. The Tesla systems are designed for different scales. The home battery, roughly four feet by three feet, would allow solar customers to have power in the event of an failure, draw from it when utility rates are higher and use more of the electricity their panels produce, easing reliance on the grid. For utilities, they can help compensate for fluctuations from intermittent sources like solar and wind — whose production can dip sharply or stop altogether — as well as meet demand during peak periods. And for businesses, they can help lower demand for electricity from the grid, which in turn can lower costly demand charges. Amazon Web Services, which manages cloud-based computing systems and has a goal to derive all its energy from renewable sources, is beginning a pilot program with Tesla in Northern California. “Batteries are important for both data center reliability and as enablers for the efficient application of renewable power,” James Hamilton, distinguished engineer at Amazon Web Services, said through a spokeswoman. “They help bridge the gap between intermittent production, from sources like wind, and the data center’s constant power demands.” \nFarhad Manjoo contributed reporting.

      "text": "Timeline: What Happened to Freddie Gray When He Was Arrested by Baltimore Police? In Chicago, the American Civil Liberties Union represented Mr. Franklin in the federal lawsuit he filed against six police officers, alleging injuries that required two reconstructive operations on his mouth. Although the city’s lawyers denied the officers had done anything wrong, the city settled the lawsuit for $135,000. At least two other Baltimore men, Jeffrey Alston and Dondi Johnson, were paralyzed after police van rides in separate cases that led to lawsuits. Mr. Alston, paralyzed from the neck down, settled for $6 million in 2004. Experts said that nationally, the tradition was no longer as prevalent as it once was. Many departments now require officers to place suspects riding in vans in seatbelts or other restraints. Some agencies use vans that allow prisoners with their hands cuffed behind their backs to hold on to belts behind them. And public scrutiny of police misconduct has helped reform agencies that might have once tolerated or ignored complaints of rough van rides. “I don’t believe this is standard operating procedure,” said Hubert Williams, a former police director of Newark, who is a consultant with the nonprofit Independent Institute. “What’s been happening through the years is that the police have changed. Policing by and large through the years has become more community-oriented and more accountable to the public. But that does not dispose of these questions. I think the absence of accountability is the reason they occur.” A version of this article appears in print on May 1, 2015, on page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: Rides That Have Served as Hard-to-Prove Retribution for the Police.

      "text": "When Nepal was hit with a powerful earthquake the tremor shattered lives, landmarks and the very landscape of the country. The scope of the disaster in photographs. The rescues were among the rare bits of good news on an otherwise dreary and rainy day during which the enormity of the tragedy continued to sink in. The death toll has already exceeded 5,800, with many more confirmed deaths expected. Although aftershocks continue, the miserable weather seemed to have persuaded an increasing number to leave the tent cities set up throughout the city, presumably for their homes. Bus service to Nepal’s remote villages began again Thursday, with the government promising free rides. And flights between some of Nepal’s smaller cities and Katmandu resumed. Officials on Thursday announced the creation of a National Reconstruction Fund to rebuild infrastructure, and the government said that it would pay families almost $1,400 for each person who died as a result of the quake in order to help defray funeral costs and other expenses. The government’s top tourism official announced that climbs of Mount Everest may resume, if climbers decide to go ahead. Many of the climbers who had hoped to reach Mount Everest’s summit have already left; at least 19 were killed in avalanches caused by the earthquake. But the rescues were the news of the day. At a news conference, Bill Berger, who is overseeing rescue efforts for the United States Agency for International Development, spoke of how extraordinary it was to save people beyond the so-called “golden” hours after a quake when the likelihood of finding survivors is best. That period, he suggested, usually ends after three days. “We had a really good day. Actually, we had a great day,” he said. “Members of our urban search-and-rescue team were able to pull a live victim out of a pile, and I think for us and the Nepalis, given us new hope in a dire situation.” \nEllen Barry reported from Katmandu, and Gardiner Harris from New Delhi. Chris Buckley and Bhadra Sharma contributed reporting from Katmandu. \nA version of this article appears in print on May 1, 2015, on page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Survivors Lay Amid Rubble and Bodies.

      "title": "Mayor De Blasio Defends Police Response to Freddie Gray Protests in New York",
      "text": "APRIL 30, 2015 Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, convened a news conference after hearing complaints about the police response from allies like the Rev. Al Sharpton. “I’ve participated in plenty of protests, on plenty of issues,” the mayor said. “I believe deeply in how nonviolent protest has achieved social change.” Photo Many marched to protest the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Credit Michael Appleton for The New York Times But, he added: “When the police give you instruction, you follow the instruction. It’s not debatable.” The arrests on Wednesday, which prompted a protest from liberal groups outside Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan, came amid a renewed debate in New York over aggressive police tactics, including an effort by the City Council to decriminalize low-level offenses, like public urination. But Mr. de Blasio’s attitude was a far cry from late last year, when he allowed similar demonstrations to spill into the city’s highways and avenues. That episode, after a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict an officer in the death of a Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, contributed to an open law enforcement rebellion against the mayor. On Thursday, as in the past on police issues, Mr. de Blasio seemed to struggle to walk a tightrope. Even as Mr. Bratton, in a separate news conference, acknowledged a “much more assertive” approach to handling street protests, the mayor insisted that “the strategic approach is exactly the same.” But the mayor eventually allowed that some “tactical adjustments” had been made in response to past cases in which officers had been injured, including a march across the Brooklyn Bridge. The result was a strained, and at times testy display by a mayor trying to balance liberal sympathies with the burdens of overseeing a police force whose tactics he once criticized. Mr. de Blasio grew visibly frustrated at the notion that the police in Union Square had been too aggressive with protesters, telling reporters, “If you guys want to sensationalize, if you think that’s your contribution to society, feel free.” Photo Police arrested 143 demonstrators. Credit Michael Appleton for The New York Times He lamented that the news media did not focus on what he cited as his accomplishments in police reform, like a drop in civilian complaints against the Police Department. Continue reading the main story In a telling shift, Mr. de Blasio rebuked his interlocutors for suggesting that some of the protesters arrested on Wednesday had done little to provoke a tough police response. In December, after the Garner protests, he lashed out at a journalist who suggested that some protesters had acted violently. To the city’s liberal advocates — some of whom had marched alongside Mr. de Blasio during his candidate days — the mayor’s response was disappointing. “All I heard was, ‘Listen to the police, do what the police say,’ ” said Gideon Oliver, a civil rights lawyer who represents a group that organized the rally. “If the mayor’s answer to problems of abuse of police discretion is ‘just listen to what police say,’ that’s obviously a very big problem.” Still, Mr. Bratton and police officials were adamant that they had acted appropriately to rein in a demonstration that was threatening to become unruly and disrupt the city’s evening rush. “Throughout the night we were extremely flexible,” Chief James P. O’Neill said at the Police Academy in Queens. “If the protests continue, we will continue to be flexible. It’s not just one strategy.” Chief O’Neill added that one precinct captain, the commander of the 13th Precinct in Manhattan, had been struck in the head with a stick. “He’s got a nice cut on his jaw,” he said.

Credit Michael Abbott/Getty Images One veteran city supervisor, who was at Union Square on Wednesday, said he had been told at the onset that the police might take a more assertive approach than in past protests. “They were free to protest on the sidewalk, and follow the law, and we would certainly let them express their rights,” said the supervisor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to detail department policies. “But if they broke the law, went into the street and stuff like that, we weren’t going to give them much and were going to start locking people up.” Aside from the arrests, the supervisor said, the night went smoothly. “No major fights,” he said. “No major assaults on cops, or cops doing anything crazy to anyone else.” Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday that the city would not take an “ironclad” approach to future protests, and would consider each demonstration case by case. “It’s a big, complicated city,” the mayor said. “I have confidence, having been a public servant, having been a protester, that the N.Y.P.D. knows how to work out every situation.” A reporter pointed out that Mr. de Blasio himself had been arrested during his run for mayor, as a show of civil disobedience to protest the closing of a public hospital in Brooklyn. The mayor scoffed and said there was no comparison to what transpired on Wednesday night. His own arrest, Mr. de Blasio said, “was the most choreographed thing on earth.” Correction: April 30, 2015 An earlier version of this article misstated where Chief James P. O’Neill spoke on Thursday about the Police Department’s response to protests in Manhattan. He was at the Police Academy in Queens, not Police Headquarters. \nMatt Flegenheimer, J. David Goodman and Benjamin Mueller contributed reporting.

      "text": " BALTIMORE — IN the wake of the Michael Brown shooting and subsequent unrest in Ferguson, Mo., commentators noted the absence of black representatives among Ferguson’s elected officials and its police leadership. A Department of Justice report highlighted how Ferguson’s mostly white City Council and its courts spurred on explicitly racist policing , in part to harvest fines from black residents.\nThen came Baltimore. The death of Freddie Gray, like those of Eric Garner, John Crawford III, Rekia Boyd and so many other unarmed African-Americans, at first seemed to fit the all-too-familiar template — white cops, black suspect, black corpse.\nBut unlike New York, Chicago and other cities with white leaders, Baltimore has a black mayor, a black police commissioner and a majority-black City Council. Yet the city still has one of the most stained records of police brutality in recent years.\nContinue reading the main story Related in Opinion Op-Ed Columnist: Violence in Baltimore APRIL 29, 2015 Op-Ed Columnist: When Baltimore Burned APRIL 29, 2015 In the absence of a perceptible “white power structure,” the discussion around Baltimore has quickly turned to one about the failings of black culture. This confuses even those who sympathize with black hardship. When people took to the streets and destroyed property, most observers did not see an understandable social response to apparent state inaction. They saw, in the words of Baltimore’s mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, “thugs,” or in the words of President Obama, “criminals and thugs.”\nTo be fair, the mayor later expressed regret, and both she and the president have tried to show empathy for the dispossessed. But they are also fighting myths about degenerate black culture. Condemning “criminals” and “thugs” seems to get them away from beliefs about broad black inferiority.\nYet when black people of influence make these arguments, it prevents us from questioning Baltimore the way we questioned Ferguson.\nInstead, we lionize people like Toya Graham , the Baltimore mother who went upside the head of her rioting son. Baltimore’s police commissioner, Anthony W. Batts, applauded her, pleading with parents to “ take control of your kids .” But the footage certainly affirms violence as the best way to get wayward black people under control.\nMoreover, by treating a moment of black-on-black violence as a bright spot, we take our eye off the circumstances that created the event. We forget, for instance, about how officials, in their fear of black youth, issued what witnesses said was a pre-emptive riot-police blockade hemming in students around Mondawmin Mall , where looting erupted.\nThe problem is not black culture. It is policy and politics, the very things that bind together the history of Ferguson and Baltimore and, for that matter, the rest of America.\nSpecifically, the problem rests on the continued profitability of racism. Freddie Gray’s exposure to lead paint as a child, his suspected participation in the drug trade, and the relative confinement of black unrest to black communities during this week’s riot are all features of a city and a country that still segregate people along racial lines, to the financial enrichment of landlords, corner store merchants and other vendors selling second-rate goods.\nContinue reading the main story Continue reading the main story The problem originates in a political culture that has long bound black bodies to questions of property. Yes, I’m referring to slavery.\nSlavery was not so much a labor system as it was a property regime, with slaves serving not just as workers, but as commodities. Back in the day, people routinely borrowed against other human beings. They took out mortgages on them. As a commodity, the slave had a value that the state was bound to protect.\nNow housing and commercial real estate have come to occupy the heart of America’s property regime, replacing slavery. And damage to real estate, far more than damage to ostensibly free black people, tends to evoke swift responses from the state. What we do not prosecute nearly well enough, however, is the daily assault on black people’s lives through the slow, willful destruction of real estate within black communities. The conditions in West Baltimore today are the direct consequence of speculative real estate practices that have long targeted people with few to no options.\nOn the heels of any ghetto economy based on extraction comes the excessive policing necessary to keep everyone in place. Cities that are starved for income have found ways to raise revenues by way of fines and fees exacted from poor, underemployed African-Americans and migrants of color. These include property taxes and court costs. In Maryland, in particular, these come in lieu of property taxes that many of the state’s largest employers are not required to pay. The dangers of tax burdens and other unseen costs are as deadly to urban households as police brutality or fires set by “thugs.”\nIn “The Wire,” Lester Freamon understood that following the money took our eyes off the street and up the chain of real political power. We have a right to expect that our administrators will use the bully pulpit to speak about the policies, systems and structures over which they preside.\nBy avoiding the language of individual failings and degenerate culture, political leaders, black and otherwise, can help us all see the daily violence of poverty. More, they can better use the power they have to do something about it. By calling a nationwide “state of emergency” on the problem of residential segregation, by devising a fairer tax structure, by investing in public space, community policing, tenants’ rights and a government jobs program, our leaders can find a way forward.",

She lived in a derelict two-bedroom trailer with a grandfather, Earl Tall, and as many as a dozen siblings and cousins. Her mother, an alcoholic, was an intermittent presence in her life. Their town, Manderson, was torn by drinking, fighting and violence.\nMr. Tall overheard his granddaughter’s talk of suicide and called her other grandfather, Keith Janis, who immediately drove 40 miles to see her. “I sat down with her and said, ‘Please, promise Grandpa you’ll never do that,’ ” Mr. Janis recalled last week. “She gave me that big, beautiful smile of hers and said, ‘O.K., Grandpa, O.K.’ ”\nSix weeks later, Santana hanged herself in a small, unheated building next to the trailer.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Pain on the Reservation JULY 12, 2013 Indian Reservation Reeling in Wave of Youth Suicides and Attempts JUNE 9, 2007 Since December, the Pine Ridge reservation , a vast, windswept land of stunning grasslands and dusty plateaus, has been the scene of an unfolding crisis: nine people between the ages of 12 and 24 have committed suicide here.\nPhoto John Yellow Bird Steele, the Oglala Sioux tribe president, last week. He declared an emergency on the reservation in February. Credit Kristina Barker for The New York Times Two teenagers hanged themselves in December. In the next three months, seven more young people were found dead, including Alanie Martin, 14, who was known for her love of basketball, cheerleading and traditional Indian hand games. When Santana killed herself in February, she followed another recent suicide of a boy who attended her school, Wounded Knee, so named for the 1890 massacre that occurred where the reservation stands today.\nMany more youths on the reservation have tried, but failed, to kill themselves in the past several months: at least 103 attempts by people ages 12 to 24 occurred from December to March, according to the federal Indian Health Service . Grim-faced emergency medical workers on the reservation, which is the size of Delaware and Rhode Island combined, say they have been called to the scenes of suicide attempts sometimes several times a day.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Tribe officials, clergy members and social workers say they cannot remember such a high rate of suicides and attempts in such a short period of time on the reservation, which is already overwhelmed with high rates of unemployment, poverty, domestic abuse and alcohol addiction.\nIn 2013, five people, including adults and children, killed themselves in a single year, according to the Oglala Sioux tribe. But officials at Pine Ridge said they were mystified by the far more pronounced increase in the past several months and had searched, unsuccessfully, for answers.\nAs the suicides began to mount in February, the Oglala Sioux tribe president, John Yellow Bird Steele, declared an emergency on the reservation. In response, the Indian Health Service deployed additional counselors, but many people here say it is not nearly enough: There are only six mental health professionals on the entire reservation, which has a population of 16,000 to 40,000 members of the tribe.\nContinue reading the main story “It is devastating,” Mr. Steele said. “I don’t know if they were cyberbullied, or if they had living conditions they didn’t want to put up with, or they were sexually abused. Were they hungry? I don’t know.”\nContinue reading the main story Related in Opinion Editorial: Abandoned in Indian Country JULY 23, 2013 Op-Ed Contributor: Broken Promises JULY 10, 2013 “When you have a good understanding of what’s happening,” he said, “come back and tell me.”\nPhoto The Badlands, viewed from the Pine Ridge reservation. The reservation is already overwhelmed with high rates of unemployment, poverty, domestic abuse and alcohol addiction. Credit Kristina Barker for The New York Times But family members and tribe officials said they had seen disturbing clues.\nOutside the Pine Ridge School, where four of its 800 students have committed suicide in recent months, Myra Slow Bear, 15, a friend of Alanie’s, said that other students had been bullying Alanie.\n“I knew she was depressed,” she said. Among teenagers at the school, she said, attempting suicide is not unusual.\n“It’s just a common thing,” she said.\nMr. Tall, Santana’s grandfather, also said that she had conflicts with other students at school. An official with knowledge of the case said that shortly before Santana committed suicide, another girl at school had written to her on Facebook, urging her to kill herself.\nSeveral officials with knowledge of the cases said that at least one of the youths who committed suicide was influenced by Slender Man, a tall, faceless creature who appears in storytelling websites, often as a figure who stalks and kills victims. Two girls in a Milwaukee suburb last summer said the character had inspired them in the attempted murder of a classmate.\n“They call him the Tall Man spirit,” said Chris Carey, a minister who works with youths, some of them suicidal, on the reservation. “He’s appearing to these kids and telling them to kill themselves.”\nPhoto “It’s just a common thing,” said Myra Slow Bear, 15, of suicide attempts on the reservation. Her friend Alanie Martin, 14, committed suicide this year. Credit Kristina Barker for The New York Times Mr. Steele, who said many Native Americans traditionally believe in a “suicide spirit” similar to Slender Man, said that young people had been sharing disturbing videos on Facebook that encourage suicide. One video, he said, gave instructions on tying a hangman’s noose. Another directed children to go to a specific place outside the village, saying there were ropes there. “Go use them,” the video instructed.\nJohn Two Bulls, a pastor who works with youths on the reservation, said that two months ago, he was tipped off to a group suicide planned in a wooded area outside the town of Pine Ridge. Frantic, he drove to the spot.\n“It was cold, it was dark, and there was a row of trees with ropes hanging off the branches,” he said. “I was thankful that we were able to get there without finding anybody hanging from those ropes.”\nSome teenagers had already congregated there, he said, and he urged them to gather around. “I counseled them, prayed with them, talked with them,” he said. They told him that “they were tired of the lives they had at home, no food, with parents all intoxicated, and some were being abused, mentally or sexually.”\nMental health professionals said they suspected that in some cases, young people might have been influenced by previous suicides. Feeling neglected, they can be attracted to the public displays of mourning that follow a death; and once they hear about the method of suicide, they imitate it.\nContinue reading the main story Continue reading the main story “Contagion does occur with teenagers,” said Stephanie Schweitzer Dixon, the executive director of the Front Porch Coalition, a suicide prevention group in Rapid City, S.D. “Kids are young, they don’t think clearly, their brains aren’t fully developed. I know that things seem to be getting worse for kids. Things seem to be getting more dire.”\nTed Hamilton, the superintendent of the Red Cloud Indian School, a Jesuit school on the reservation, said that suicide is an issue that schools grapple with constantly.\nPhoto Boys playing basketball on the reservation last week. Children on reservations face a variety of challenges including a legacy of oppression and forced removals and the lack of jobs and economic opportunity. Credit Kristina Barker for The New York Times “To be Lakota in this world is a challenge because they want to maintain their own culture, but they’re being told their culture is not successful,” Mr. Hamilton said.\nChildren on Indian reservations, he added, have extraordinary challenges: the legacy of oppression and forced removals, the lack of jobs and economic opportunity, and the high levels of drug and alcohol use around them.\n“The federal government has dropped the ball in terms of mental health resources,” Mr. Hamilton said. “The system is overwhelmed. No matter which reservation you go to, that’s what you’ll find.”\nRon Cornelius, the Great Plains director of the Indian Health Service, said in a statement that the recent suicides were “an incredibly sad situation” that the agency was determined to address. “I.H.S. is committed to working with the tribe to address this heartbreaking problem,” he said.\nWhen Mr. Janis, a longtime activist, talks about Santana’s death, he points to the “multigenerational trauma” inflicted on Native Americans by whites and the tensions that still exist between the groups. On an overnight trip to Rapid City over the New Year, a group of girls including Santana overheard a white woman call them “filthy Indians” as they passed through a hotel lobby, he said.\n“My beautiful Lakota granddaughter,” he said. “She had to hear that. Our kids today just want to die because they’re sick of all this oppression.”\nLast week, at the Pine Ridge Gospel Fellowship, a small, white clapboard church in the heart of the reservation, a group of clergy members, social workers and tribal elders met for an informal prayer session.\nAs one pastor played hymns on an acoustic guitar, Norma Blacksmith, who lost a grandson to suicide several years ago, bowed her head and closed her eyes.\n“In our culture, Lord, the children are sacred,” she said. “We thank you that there have been no suicides in this last week. You answered our prayer.”\nLoading...

She considered the chance to spend a few hours with a bouncy 4-year-old one of the chief benefits of her job. Ms. Simon is a partner at the Geller Law Group, a six-woman firm, the founding credo of which is family-friendliness and whose stance on office face time is best described as “militantly against.”\n Related Coverage Essay: The Complicated Origins of ‘Having It All’ JAN. 2, 2015 Burdened With Debt, Law School Graduates Struggle in Job Market APRIL 26, 2015 Special Section: Female-Run Venture Capital Funds Alter the Status Quo APRIL 1, 2015 Straightening Out the Work-Life Balance SEPT. 1, 2012 In addition to practicing law, Ms. Simon and her law partner, Rebecca Geller, have a near-evangelical determination to show that parents can nurture their professional ambitions while being fully present in their children’s lives. Ms. Simon has such conviction on this point that she is almost personally offended by suggestions it might not be possible. The widely read and debated 2012 essay in The Atlantic “Why Women Still Can’t Have It All,” by Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former State Department official, is a particular source of irritation. “I think women can have it all,” she said. “It’s just based on your paradigm of ‘all.’ ”\nPhoto Ms. Simon and Jack at home. She is a partner at the Geller Law Group, whose guiding principle is family-friendliness. Credit Lexey Swall for The New York Times Ms. Simon’s paradigm is not what the popularizer of the term would have endorsed. In 1982, Helen Gurley Brown, the longtime editor of Cosmopolitan, published a book called “Having It All: Love, Success, Sex, Money, Even if You’re Starting With Nothing.” As Jennifer Szalai noted in a recent essay in The New York Times Magazine, Ms. Brown didn’t have children and wasn’t especially eager to incorporate them into her vision of modern womanhood. But the phrase somehow stuck as a shorthand for the aspiration of working mothers — or, depending on your view, a fantasy that women were doomed to fall short of.\nWhile the legal profession doesn’t offer the grimmest odds in this regard — that honor probably goes to finance — the challenges it poses are considerable. Not least is that would-be partners must typically bill more than 2,000 hours a year, easily a 60- to 70-hour workweek once you allow for human interaction and trips to the bathroom.\nWomen accounted for a mere 16.5 percent of law partners in 2013, according to the National Association for Law Placement , despite graduating from law school in roughly equal numbers as men over the previous decade, according to the American Bar Association . A 2007 report by the M.I.T. Workplace Center found that by far the most important reason women gave for deserting the partnership track was “the difficulty of combining law firm work and caring for children in a system that requires long hours under high pressure with little or inconsistent support for flexible work arrangements.”\n The M.I.T. study mirrored complaints I heard while reporting on a large Chicago firm called Mayer Brown for The New Republic two years ago. One former Mayer Brown associate told me that when the firm’s female partners held seminars on achieving work-life balance, the advice was frequently “Outsource your life,” which, they explained, meant finding a spouse willing to stay at home with children, or hiring a nanny, cook and housekeeper.\nIt’s this outsourcing that so depresses Ms. Simon and Ms. Geller, who consider domestic obligations central to the “all” they’ve set their sights on.\nMs. Geller wanted to spend part of her daytime hours around her children without giving up on a legal career. “I saw no role models who didn’t have a husband as a stay-at-home dad,” Ms. Geller said of the partners at the large firm she left before starting the Geller Law Group in 2011. Ms. Simon wanted to be home for dinner and attend school events without worrying about how it would affect her annual review.\nAnd so their partnership became a small-scale experiment in parenting while employed. Their lives are not so different from those of many other parents. And like all experiments, the reality has been messier than the theory.\nBy 10 a.m. on that Wednesday in March, Ms. Simon was seated in front of a client, formerly the president of a condominium association that was now suing him. (The client gave me permission to sit in on the meeting.)\nMs. Simon began to review each count of the civil complaint against him, MacBook open and legal pad at the ready. She had a litigator’s game face that was only occasionally undone by a wry smile she couldn’t quite suppress.\n“I have to ask,” Ms. Simon said at one point. “Did you ever falsely represent yourself as an attorney?” The client explained that he had once told a local agency that he was appearing before it as an attorney but that he had meant it “in the British sense,” in that he had power of attorney. “You know you’re not supposed to say that, right?” Ms. Simon deadpanned.\n“Yes, lesson learned,” he said.\nPhoto Ms. Simon, left, and her law partner, Rebecca Geller, center, do not have a set office but instead rent rooms at a shared work space by the hour or day. Credit Lexey Swall for The New York Times Ms. Simon joined the Geller Law Group two years ago. She previously worked at a boutique Washington firm, but the demands were too much after she had Jack. (One telltale sign: An opposing counsel asked why she was still emailing him while in labor.) In 2013, a mutual friend suggested she reach out to Ms. Geller. They spent part of their get-to-know-you coffee meeting talking about their kids’ schedules. “It was: ‘How does this work? How can this work?’ ” Ms. Simon recalled. She agreed to join part time.\nWithin a few months, however, the 10- to 15-hour-a-week commitment became 60 to 70. The firm was growing rapidly, helping clients set up trusts and wills, doing small-business incorporations, even handling the occasional marital dispute, and Ms. Simon found the work exhilarating. (The partners limit their litigation business because court appearances and filing deadlines mean less control over their schedules.) She was also going through a divorce, making full-time employment a sudden necessity.\n In the informal division of labor between the two partners, Ms. Geller is the rainmaker, generating most of the clients, and also deals with payroll and insurance, while Ms. Simon mostly handles and supervises the legal work. At a traditional law firm, this can lead to vastly different expectations of office time. The rainmakers are expected to schmooze with clients on a golf course; the worker bees are supposed to hover over their desks.\nAdvertisement\n A mild version of this injustice lives on at the Geller Law Group. Ms. Geller, who has two boys ages 6 and 4 and a 12-month-old girl, spends Tuesdays and Thursdays with her younger two children, shepherding them to music classes and play dates and squeezing in work while they rest. Many of her tasks, like introductory phone calls and managing the daily inflow of client queries, can be wedged in throughout the day.\nShe recently took all three children to the doctor. “I had five minutes once Emily calmed down,” Ms. Geller said, thrilled to have a productive window during the chaos of the annual checkup. “I sent six emails.”\nFor Ms. Simon, the work unfolds across longer increments — writing legal documents, taking depositions and appearing in court. She expects to work a full day most days, and her weekly hours still hover above 60. But she values the flexibility to duck out — for an afternoon preschool party, for example — and make up the time at night. She takes home roughly half the $250,000 to $300,000 she estimates she would earn at a large firm and says the freedom she purchased has come at a relative bargain.\nOne reason Ms. Simon and Ms. Geller don’t feel they have to sneak out of the office is that there are no offices. The firm shuns a permanent home in favor of a shared work space managed by a company called Metro Offices, where it rents a conference room for an hour, an office for a day, as needed. Ms. Geller typically appears there once a week; Ms. Simon two or three times.\nThey did this partly to encourage their employees to work from home and on their own schedules. “My old firm would drive me bonkers,” Ms. Geller said. “If I have a slow week, why can’t I take a day, run errands? You’d better believe, when something urgent comes in, I’m going to work an all-nighter.” Four of the six employees have young children, and two set aside standing blocks of time to spend with them each week.\nThe other advantage is to hold down expenses, of course, which allows the Geller Law Group to maintain reasonable profit margins while charging less than competitors with higher overhead. (Ms. Simon and Ms. Geller, who bill themselves out at $280 an hour, conducted market research. Ms. Simon was determined to stay under $300 for the same psychological reason that “real estate agents price things at $999,000.”) To keep track of one another, the lawyers and a paralegal meticulously update their shared Google calendars and communicate constantly through Gchat.\nMs. Simon delights in the guerrilla-style logistics of a mostly virtual firm. She says clients generally don’t know that the firm doesn’t have its own space, though she tells them if they ask. If clients call the firm’s main number, they are greeted by an automated switchboard. Ms. Simon’s extension and direct dial go to a landline at her home in Washington — a custom-ordered Vonage number with a Virginia area code and the same first digit as the firm’s. When she’s not at home, those calls are forwarded to her cellphone.\n This structure is not for everyone. The firm’s lone male associate, Michael Munson, told me he quit in January because he craved the camaraderie of colleagues. But it’s a style that’s rapidly proliferating, with dozens of similar firms opening around the country over the last decade, according to Joan C. Williams of the Center for WorkLife Law at University of California Hastings College of the Law.\nPhoto Ms. Geller helping her son, Noah, 4, add water to a toy swimming pool at home on a recent Sunday. “I saw no role models who didn’t have a husband as a stay-at-home dad,” Ms. Geller said of her cohort at the large firm she left before starting the Geller Law Group in 2011. Credit Lexey Swall for The New York Times Most days, the Geller Law Group’s arrangements work seamlessly. Some days they do not. Half an hour after the former condo association president left, Ms. Simon was checking email when a Metro Offices receptionist announced that she would have to vacate the conference room for the next booking. Two Metro Offices employees had a spirited debate over which room Ms. Simon had rented for the rest of the day, before directing her to Room 22. But when Ms. Simon trooped down the hall and opened the door, she found it occupied by her paralegal, Crystal Martinez. She stepped out for lunch and returned 30 minutes later (this time to Room 19) for a meeting with her associate, Sophia Chase, who recently moved from Washington to North Carolina.\nAfter Barack Obama won the presidency, he committed to making his White House family-friendly, to which Rahm Emanuel, then his chief of staff, aptly retorted , “Family-friendly to your family.” The Geller Law Group tries to be family-friendly, but not in the White House sense. Ms. Martinez, the paralegal, joined the firm because she wanted to work a reduced schedule after having a child in 2013. Her previous employer, a larger Washington firm, informed her that only lawyers could work a reduced schedule, not paralegals.\nMs. Chase told me that one of the major benefits of working at the Geller Law Group was that she wouldn’t have to disrupt her career path when she decided to have a baby. (Ms. Geller later brought up that comment happily. “She’s never said that as openly about the pregnancy,” she told me. “At my old place, I never would have said that out loud. I’m glad she said that.”)\nStill, there are challenges. Despite the firm’s low overhead, losing one lawyer’s revenue for several months of maternity leave would be a major strain on its finances, the partners said. During the first three years of its existence, Ms. Simon and Ms. Geller didn’t even have a parental leave policy because there were no pregnant women or expectant spouses on their payroll, other than Ms. Geller herself. This month, they finally bought short-term disability insurance that would enable them to offer 60 percent paid leave for eight weeks and an additional four weeks unpaid. Large firms typically offer 14 to 16 weeks at full salary, according to Deborah Epstein Henry, a legal industry consultant who specializes in workplace issues.\nIt’s one of the conundrums of the work-life conflict: Large firms have the resources to accommodate lawyers’ family obligations. They just aren’t very hospitable in practice. Nationwide, 98 percent of law firms officially allow their lawyers to work reduced schedules, according to the National Association for Law Placement; only 6 percent of lawyers actually work part time. By contrast, many small firms have the right inclinations but lack the resources to follow through.\n At 3 p.m., Ms. Simon and Ms. Geller were scheduled to meet with a client, a team of political consultants who wanted to incorporate as a partnership. To make it back to Washington in time to pick up her son, Ms. Simon had to be on the road no later than 4:40. This would normally have left her plenty of time for the meeting, but the consultants were running late.\nMs. Simon and Ms. Geller acknowledge that outsourcing one’s parenting has advantages — like knowing that someone else will tend to the children when work spills past its allotted time. In place of this certainty are dozens of tiny trade-offs: When is a client matter sufficiently urgent to delay parenting, and which clients can be put off or rescheduled as the need arises?\nThe inescapability of these calculations is perhaps the biggest psychic cost of the flexible schedule, according to others who have experimented with it. Joanne Sternlieb is a former big-firm lawyer who set up her own legal practice in 2002 so she could raise two children and squeeze in swim meets and school plays while working. But she sold her practice 10 years later, after her older daughter hit adolescence.\n“When they were younger, I needed to be there physically, to attend events,” she said. Later, “it was important for me to not just be there physically but emotionally.”\nAt 4:30, Ms. Simon extricated herself from the political consultants, leaving Ms. Geller to cover. “We told them from the get-go I had to leave by 4:30, and they were half an hour late,” she said matter-of-factly. By 5:30, she was caught in punishing rush-hour traffic and second-guessing her navigational judgment. “Maybe I should have taken 14th,” she muttered.\nIt’s a contemporary daydream to wonder what the workplace might look like if it were run entirely by women, or at least by fully engaged parents. The answer, it seems, is this: There would be no revolution. Working parents would still be exhausted and distracted and anxious about falling short in every aspect of their lives. Ms. Simon says she sleeps fewer than six hours most nights, and she is frequently awakened after nodding off by the impact of her Kindle on her forehead. But it would help at the margins. And the margins are very likely to be the difference between an impossible combination of professional ambition and parental devotion and a manageable one, if only barely so.\nAt 5:50 p.m., Ms. Simon finally pulled up to Jack’s school, with 10 minutes to spare.\n“Mommy, I have an idea,” he said after being strapped into his car seat. “Why don’t we eat noodles and watch superheroes?” Ms. Simon, a sly grin on her face, allowed that it was a good one.\nLoading...

      "text": "APRIL 21, 2015 Europe’s migration crisis escalated sharply in April, with the coming of warmer weather in the Mediterranean. Many more smugglers’ boats took to the sea, and a record number of migrants died attempting the crossing — more than 1,700 people so far in 2015, by some estimates. Photo At Umberto I, a migrant detention center in Syracuse, Sicily, men who were held there said they did not know the status of their asylum applications. Credit Luca Bruno/Associated Press Conflicts in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia have shaped and reshaped Europe’s migrant flows in recent years, with none more transformative to the Mediterranean smuggling trade than the civil war in Syria. And the tumult in Libya is changing the migration equation once again. Libyan lawlessness has allowed a haven for smugglers to operate along the country’s coastline, but it has also unmoored many African laborers who were working there as migrants. Many of these men now languish in Italian detention centers without contacts or plans for the future, and their growing numbers are frustrating some Italian mayors and other officials. “We don’t know anything,” said one migrant, Shamsudeen Sawud, 18, who arrived in Italy more than a week ago. “No one is telling us anything.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Migration statistics offer a hint of the shift. More than 170,000 migrants and refugees arrived in Italy by sea last year; Syrians and Eritreans were the two largest groups among them, accounting for more than 76,000 people, according to Italy’s interior ministry. Gambians ranked a distant fifth. Yet during the first quarter of 2015, a relatively slow period with just 10,165 arrivals — Gambia was the leading country of origin, accounting for 1,413 of the migrants. The authorities have not published figures for April yet, but humanitarian and migration groups confirm that a majority of the arriving migrants came originally from sub-Saharan African countries — some directly, with Italy as a destination, but many end up here less deliberately. “We see that even people who had originally moved to Libya with the intention to remain there — including both refugees and migrants — have now decided to flee toward Europe, even though it means risking their lives in a very dangerous journey at sea,” Matteo de Bellis, the Italy representative for Amnesty International, said in an email. Continue reading the main story Bruce Leimsidor, an expert on Europe’s asylum system, said a certain amount of skepticism should be applied, because migrants may make such claims in the hope that it will help their requests for asylum in Europe. Before the fall of the Qaddafi government, Mr. Leimsidor said, hundreds of thousands of West Africans, as well as many Bangladeshis, worked in Libya to save money for an eventual return home, and never planned to move on to Europe, but the situation was very different now. “It has been several years now that work in Libya for the migrants has been quite scarce,” Mr. Leimsidor, who teaches European asylum law at Ca’ Foscari University in Venice, said in an email. Given that scarcity and the dangers of violence in the country, he said, “those who have come into Libya in the last few years have had at least some intention of coming to Europe.” ",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is scrambling for reassurances it can present this month at a Camp David summit meeting to persuade Arab allies that the United States has their backs, despite a pending nuclear deal with Iran .\nOfficials at the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department have been meeting to discuss everything from joint training missions for American and Arab militaries (more likely) to additional weapons sales to a loose defense pact that could signal that the United States would back those allies if they come under attack from Iran.\nOver mahi-mahi at a dinner at the Pentagon two weeks ago, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter polled a select group of Middle East experts for advice on how the administration could placate Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and Qatar , all of which fear the nuclear deal, according to several attendees at the dinner.\nMr. Carter wanted to know “how do you make clear to the G.C.C. that America isn’t going to hand the house keys of the Persian Gulf over to Iran and then pivot to Asia?” said one Middle East expert at the dinner, using the acronym for the Gulf Cooperation Council. The council includes Bahrain, Kuwait , Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\nOn April 20, during lunch with President Obama at the White House, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, pressed for a defense pact with the United States, according to a senior administration official. The president in turn sought support from the Emirates for the Iran nuclear deal, which Secretary of State John Kerry is negotiating.\nAdministration officials said Mr. Obama had not settled on what to offer but that there were several possible options, most of them difficult to pull off. A security treaty with Saudi Arabia and the other countries is unlikely because that would have to be ratified by Congress and would probably run into opposition from Israel and its supporters on Capitol Hill.\nBut instead of a full-fledged security treaty — like the one the United States has with Japan ensuring that America will come to Japan’s defense — the administration is discussing offering a looser, less-binding defense pact. In the deal envisioned, American officials would put in writing, but not send to Congress, language agreeing to the defense of Arab allies if they come under attack from outside forces. Such a pact would not apply if the governments came under attack from political opponents within their own countries, since the last thing the administration wants is to get involved in future uprisings like the Arab Spring.\nThere is not much time left to come up with something. Mr. Kerry is to meet next week with the foreign ministers of the Arab countries to prepare for the Camp David summit meeting on May 14, and he will be expected to foreshadow what kind of package the administration is willing to offer. If he does not have anything that satisfies the gulf allies, they may downgrade their attendance at the Camp David meeting. Saudi Arabia, for example, could send its crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, instead of King Salman, in what would widely be interpreted as a rebuff of Mr. Obama.\nContinue reading the main story Continue reading the main story Another option the administration is considering is whether to make Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates “major non-NATO allies,” a designation that would loosen up restrictions on weapons sales. The designation falls short of a defense pact but does grant a number of military advantages that are available only to NATO allies.\nBahrain and Kuwait are already designated as such allies. Former President George W. Bush gave Kuwait the status in 2004 after it supported the American-led invasion of Iraq and served as a staging ground for United States troops. Bahrain, the home of the United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet, got the designation in 2002.\nBut neither Saudi Arabia nor the United Arab Emirates has the designation that could help soothe Arab fears, said Kenneth M. Pollack, an expert on Middle East political and military affairs at the Brookings Institution.\n“The gulf states are very concerned about this nuclear deal with Iran,’’ Mr. Pollack said. “Some of them believe this is the start of an Obama administration bid to trade them away.” Administration officials, he said, were “trying to think creatively about how they can assuage those fears.”\nIncreased weapons sales could help, but there is a major roadblock: maintaining Israel’s military edge. The United States has long put restrictions on the types of weapons that American defense firms can sell to Arab nations, which are meant to ensure that Israel keeps a military advantage against its traditional adversaries in the region. That is why the administration has so far not allowed Lockheed Martin to sell the F-35 fighter jet , considered to be the jewel of America’s future arsenal of weapons, to Arab countries. The plane, the world’s most expensive weapons project, has stealth abilities and has been approved for sale to Israel.\nDefense analysts say that with the balance of power in the Middle East in flux, that could change. One possibility would be to wait three years after delivering the F-35 to Israel and then approve it for sale to the United Arab Emirates — the Arab ally most likely to get the first chance to buy the stealth fighter — which would give Israel a three-year head start.\nIf the Arab allies “could push a button and have anything, they want a security pact, a Japan-style treaty,” said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “ But they’re cognizant of the fact that that’s too big of an ask. So at the very minimum, it’s weapons sales.”\nVali R. Nasr, a former special adviser to Mr. Obama who is now dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said that the administration had already made moves to reassure the Arab allies — most notably by supporting Saudi-led airstrikes against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and by moving an aircraft carrier group to the Yemeni coast. The warships were meant as a show of force to turn back an Iranian convoy, which American officials said they suspected was trying to deliver weapons to the Houthis.\n“Remember, our dog in the fight in Yemen is Al Qaeda, not the Houthis,” Mr. Nasr said. Moving the carrier group to back the Saudis “wasn’t about Yemen. It was about alliance management. “\nLoading...

      "text": "“When you have a good understanding of what’s happening,” he said, “come back and tell me.” Photo The Badlands, viewed from the Pine Ridge reservation. The reservation is already overwhelmed with high rates of unemployment, poverty, domestic abuse and alcohol addiction. Credit Kristina Barker for The New York Times But family members and tribe officials said they had seen disturbing clues. Outside the Pine Ridge School, where four of its 800 students have committed suicide in recent months, Myra Slow Bear, 15, a friend of Alanie’s, said that other students had been bullying Alanie. “I knew she was depressed,” she said. Among teenagers at the school, she said, attempting suicide is not unusual. “It’s just a common thing,” she said. Mr. Tall, Santana’s grandfather, also said that she had conflicts with other students at school. An official with knowledge of the case said that shortly before Santana committed suicide, another girl at school had written to her on Facebook, urging her to kill herself. Several officials with knowledge of the cases said that at least one of the youths who committed suicide was influenced by Slender Man, a tall, faceless creature who appears in storytelling websites, often as a figure who stalks and kills victims. Two girls in a Milwaukee suburb last summer said the character had inspired them in the attempted murder of a classmate. “They call him the Tall Man spirit,” said Chris Carey, a minister who works with youths, some of them suicidal, on the reservation. “He’s appearing to these kids and telling them to kill themselves.” Photo “It’s just a common thing,” said Myra Slow Bear, 15, of suicide attempts on the reservation. Her friend Alanie Martin, 14, committed suicide this year. Credit Kristina Barker for The New York Times Mr. Steele, who said many Native Americans traditionally believe in a “suicide spirit” similar to Slender Man, said that young people had been sharing disturbing videos on Facebook that encourage suicide. One video, he said, gave instructions on tying a hangman’s noose. Another directed children to go to a specific place outside the village, saying there were ropes there. “Go use them,” the video instructed. John Two Bulls, a pastor who works with youths on the reservation, said that two months ago, he was tipped off to a group suicide planned in a wooded area outside the town of Pine Ridge. Frantic, he drove to the spot. “It was cold, it was dark, and there was a row of trees with ropes hanging off the branches,” he said. “I was thankful that we were able to get there without finding anybody hanging from those ropes.” Some teenagers had already congregated there, he said, and he urged them to gather around. “I counseled them, prayed with them, talked with them,” he said. They told him that “they were tired of the lives they had at home, no food, with parents all intoxicated, and some were being abused, mentally or sexually.” Mental health professionals said they suspected that in some cases, young people might have been influenced by previous suicides. Feeling neglected, they can be attracted to the public displays of mourning that follow a death; and once they hear about the method of suicide, they imitate it. Continue reading the main story “Contagion does occur with teenagers,” said Stephanie Schweitzer Dixon, the executive director of the Front Porch Coalition, a suicide prevention group in Rapid City, S.D. “Kids are young, they don’t think clearly, their brains aren’t fully developed. I know that things seem to be getting worse for kids. Things seem to be getting more dire.” Ted Hamilton, the superintendent of the Red Cloud Indian School, a Jesuit school on the reservation, said that suicide is an issue that schools grapple with constantly. Photo Boys playing basketball on the reservation last week. Children on reservations face a variety of challenges including a legacy of oppression and forced removals and the lack of jobs and economic opportunity. Credit Kristina Barker for The New York Times “To be Lakota in this world is a challenge because they want to maintain their own culture, but they’re being told their culture is not successful,” Mr. Hamilton said. Children on Indian reservations, he added, have extraordinary challenges: the legacy of oppression and forced removals, the lack of jobs and economic opportunity, and the high levels of drug and alcohol use around them. “The federal government has dropped the ball in terms of mental health resources,” Mr. Hamilton said. “The system is overwhelmed. No matter which reservation you go to, that’s what you’ll find.” Ron Cornelius, the Great Plains director of the Indian Health Service, said in a statement that the recent suicides were “an incredibly sad situation” that the agency was determined to address. “I.H.S. is committed to working with the tribe to address this heartbreaking problem,” he said. When Mr. Janis, a longtime activist, talks about Santana’s death, he points to the “multigenerational trauma” inflicted on Native Americans by whites and the tensions that still exist between the groups. On an overnight trip to Rapid City over the New Year, a group of girls including Santana overheard a white woman call them “filthy Indians” as they passed through a hotel lobby, he said. “My beautiful Lakota granddaughter,” he said. “She had to hear that. Our kids today just want to die because they’re sick of all this oppression.” Last week, at the Pine Ridge Gospel Fellowship, a small, white clapboard church in the heart of the reservation, a group of clergy members, social workers and tribal elders met for an informal prayer session. As one pastor played hymns on an acoustic guitar, Norma Blacksmith, who lost a grandson to suicide several years ago, bowed her head and closed her eyes. “In our culture, Lord, the children are sacred,” she said. “We thank you that there have been no suicides in this last week. You answered our prayer.” Loading...",

      "text": "Graphic: Chris Christie and the Lane Closings: A Spectator​’s Guide The exact charges Mr. Wildstein would plead guilty to were not immediately clear. Typically, he would appear in court to answer a series of questions confirming the details he was acknowledging in his plea. That plea will be heavily watched for what Mr. Wildstein indicates about what role – if any — Mr. Christie had in the lane closings, which gridlocked the town of Fort Lee, N.J., over four days, stranding emergency vehicles, commuters and school buses. Mr. Wildstein told several people in the Christie administration that he had discussed the lane closings with the governor as they were happening, an assertion the governor denies. And through his lawyer, Mr. Wildstein has said that other “evidence exists” that Mr. Christie knew about the closings as they occurred. The lawyer, Alan Zegas, did not return calls and emails seeking comment this week. Mr. Wildstein resigned as the director of interstate capital projects at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in December 2013, as details began to cast doubt on the Christie administration’s assertions that the lane closings were part of a traffic study. The scandal blew open a month later, after the leaking of an email Mr. Wildstein had received from a deputy chief of staff to Mr. Christie, calling for “some traffic problems in Fort Lee.” Documents released as part of a legislative inquiry into the closings indicated that the administration had been trying to freeze out the town’s mayor after he declined to endorse Mr. Christie’s re-election. Photo David Wildstein during a legislative hearing on the George Washington Bridge lane closings on Jan. 9, 2014. Credit Ángel Franco/The New York Times The lane-closing fiasco set off a decline of fortunes for Mr. Christie, who had emerged from his 2013 re-election as one of the Republican Party’s most promising hopes for the 2016 presidential contest. An investigation into what started as political payback — shutting down access lanes to the world’s busiest bridge to punish a local official — has come to include questions about patronage at the Port Authority and the effort by Mr. Christie’s administration and re-election campaign to secure endorsements from a broad spectrum of local officials. Continue reading the main story Interviews and subpoenas have indicated that investigators from the United States attorney’s office have gone beyond the lane closings to also look into the administration’s efforts to conceal them as a traffic study. In recent months, the investigation expanded further to look into allegations that David Samson, a longtime confidant to Mr. Christie and the chairman of the authority, pressured United Airlines to reinstate a flight to an airport near his weekend home in South Carolina. Several sources close to the investigation said this week that they believed that the indictment would not include Mr. Samson, but that an indictment involving the so-called “chairman’s flight” would come at a later date. Three access lanes from Fort Lee to the bridge were narrowed into one for several days starting on the first day of school in 2013, blocked emergency vehicles and stranding school buses and commuters. Documents later revealed that officials in the Christie administration and at the authority, which runs the bridge, purposely ignored communications from the town’s mayor that pleaded with them to reopen the lanes and questioned whether he was being punished. For three months, officials said the closings had been part of a traffic study. That story was discredited by testimony by bridge workers before the State Legislature in December 2013. The next month, documents that had been subpoenaed by the legislature were leaked, revealing the email from the deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly. Mr. Christie said then that he had not previously known that anyone on his staff was involved, and has repeatedly said that he did not plan or know about the lane closings in advance. Loading... ",

      "text": "Black Culture Is Not the Problem By N. D. B. CONNOLLY MAY 1, 2015 Continue reading the main story BALTIMORE — IN the wake of the Michael Brown shooting and subsequent unrest in Ferguson, Mo., commentators noted the absence of black representatives among Ferguson’s elected officials and its police leadership. A Department of Justice report highlighted how Ferguson’s mostly white City Council and its courts spurred on explicitly racist policing , in part to harvest fines from black residents. Then came Baltimore. The death of Freddie Gray, like those of Eric Garner, John Crawford III, Rekia Boyd and so many other unarmed African-Americans, at first seemed to fit the all-too-familiar template — white cops, black suspect, black corpse. But unlike New York, Chicago and other cities with white leaders, Baltimore has a black mayor, a black police commissioner and a majority-black City Council. Yet the city still has one of the most stained records of police brutality in recent years. APRIL 29, 2015 In the absence of a perceptible “white power structure,” the discussion around Baltimore has quickly turned to one about the failings of black culture. This confuses even those who sympathize with black hardship. When people took to the streets and destroyed property, most observers did not see an understandable social response to apparent state inaction. They saw, in the words of Baltimore’s mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, “thugs,” or in the words of President Obama, “criminals and thugs.” To be fair, the mayor later expressed regret, and both she and the president have tried to show empathy for the dispossessed. But they are also fighting myths about degenerate black culture. Condemning “criminals” and “thugs” seems to get them away from beliefs about broad black inferiority. Yet when black people of influence make these arguments, it prevents us from questioning Baltimore the way we questioned Ferguson. Instead, we lionize people like Toya Graham , the Baltimore mother who went upside the head of her rioting son. Baltimore’s police commissioner, Anthony W. Batts, applauded her, pleading with parents to “ take control of your kids .” But the footage certainly affirms violence as the best way to get wayward black people under control. Moreover, by treating a moment of black-on-black violence as a bright spot, we take our eye off the circumstances that created the event. We forget, for instance, about how officials, in their fear of black youth, issued what witnesses said was a pre-emptive riot-police blockade hemming in students around Mondawmin Mall , where looting erupted. The problem is not black culture. It is policy and politics, the very things that bind together the history of Ferguson and Baltimore and, for that matter, the rest of America. Specifically, the problem rests on the continued profitability of racism. Freddie Gray’s exposure to lead paint as a child, his suspected participation in the drug trade, and the relative confinement of black unrest to black communities during this week’s riot are all features of a city and a country that still segregate people along racial lines, to the financial enrichment of landlords, corner store merchants and other vendors selling second-rate goods. Continue reading the main story The problem originates in a political culture that has long bound black bodies to questions of property. Yes, I’m referring to slavery. Slavery was not so much a labor system as it was a property regime, with slaves serving not just as workers, but as commodities. Back in the day, people routinely borrowed against other human beings. They took out mortgages on them. As a commodity, the slave had a value that the state was bound to protect. Now housing and commercial real estate have come to occupy the heart of America’s property regime, replacing slavery. And damage to real estate, far more than damage to ostensibly free black people, tends to evoke swift responses from the state. What we do not prosecute nearly well enough, however, is the daily assault on black people’s lives through the slow, willful destruction of real estate within black communities. The conditions in West Baltimore today are the direct consequence of speculative real estate practices that have long targeted people with few to no options. On the heels of any ghetto economy based on extraction comes the excessive policing necessary to keep everyone in place. Cities that are starved for income have found ways to raise revenues by way of fines and fees exacted from poor, underemployed African-Americans and migrants of color. These include property taxes and court costs. In Maryland, in particular, these come in lieu of property taxes that many of the state’s largest employers are not required to pay. The dangers of tax burdens and other unseen costs are as deadly to urban households as police brutality or fires set by “thugs.” In “The Wire,” Lester Freamon understood that following the money took our eyes off the street and up the chain of real political power. We have a right to expect that our administrators will use the bully pulpit to speak about the policies, systems and structures over which they preside. By avoiding the language of individual failings and degenerate culture, political leaders, black and otherwise, can help us all see the daily violence of poverty. More, they can better use the power they have to do something about it. By calling a nationwide “state of emergency” on the problem of residential segregation, by devising a fairer tax structure, by investing in public space, community policing, tenants’ rights and a government jobs program, our leaders can find a way forward.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story BALTIMORE — Medical examiners on Friday delivered an autopsy report on Freddie Gray, who died of an injury sustained in police custody, to Baltimore’s chief prosecutor, Marilyn J. Mosby, as the focus in the case shifts squarely to her. The office of the state chief medical examiner said it would not make its findings public, leaving that decision up to Ms. Mosby, the state’s attorney. She called a news conference for 10:30 a.m. Ms. Mosby takes on the case able to draw on relatively little experience, but with the support of many of the city’s black leaders and prominent police critics. “Whatever judgment she comes up with, I will accept it — I have that much faith in her,” Representative Elijah E. Cummings told CNN on Friday morning. “Her integrity is impeccable.” The Police Department completed its initial investigation into Mr. Gray’s death and also handed its findings to Ms Mosby’s office, on Thursday. Prosecutors added the police work to their own investigation, and Commissioner Anthony W. Batts said his department will now take direction from them about what leads to pursue. That put Ms. Mosby, in office for less than four months, on the hot seat. She has the leading role in determining what happened to Mr. Gray, and whether to pursue criminal charges against police officers. That could be a political tightrope walk in a city roiled by civil unrest, with thousands of demonstrators demanding police reform and punishment. But some of the most prominent figures making those demands, like Mr. Cummings, have also expressed high confidence in Ms. Mosby, 35, who is married to a city councilman and has other ties to the city’s political establishment. William H. Murphy, Jr., the prominent lawyer and former judge representing Mr. Gray’s family, has also voiced confidence in her judgment in the case, and the mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, has asked the public to be patient and give Ms. Mosby time to do her job. Last year, Mr. Murphy endorsed Ms. Mosby, helping her achieve an upset win over an incumbent state’s attorney. Demonstrations continued in Baltimore on Thursday night, but the city was fairly quiet, in contrast to the violence that broke out earlier in the week. With thousands of National Guard troops and officers from outside police forces patrolling the streets, people largely observed the 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew imposed on Monday. On Thursday, the police revealed that the van officers used to carry Mr. Gray after he was arrested on April 12 made a previously undisclosed stop en route to a police station. The new stop turned up on video taken from “a privately owned camera,” said the deputy police commissioner, Kevin Davis. He added that it was “previously unknown to us,” but he did not elaborate. His statement suggested that no police officers told investigators about the stop. Six officers have been suspended with pay over the death of Mr. Gray, who suffered a fatal injury to his neck while in police custody. Asked later if the commanders were saying that officers had lied or covered something up, a Police Department spokesman, Capt. J. Eric Kowalczyk, said, “It would be inappropriate for us to further comment.” Continue reading the main story In a statement, Ms. Mosby said: “While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified. We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.” Several news organizations reported Thursday and Friday that according to law enforcement sources, Mr. Gray suffered a head injury while in the police van. The Police Department declined to confirm or deny that, but it has acknowledged that Mr. Gray had not been wearing a seatbelt, contrary to policy, and that he should have received medical treatment sooner. In a sometimes defensive appearance on Thursday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake offered a rebuttal to criticism that she was not sensitive enough to the city’s poor and had not done enough to rein in police misconduct. Referring to herself, Ms. Mosby and the nation’s new attorney general, Loretta E. Lynch, the mayor said, “If, with the nation watching, three black women at three different levels can’t get justice and healing for this community, you tell me where we’re going to get it in our country.” The Police Department handed over its findings to prosecutors a day ahead of the May 1 deadline the police commissioner, Anthony W. Batts, had set. They arrived after days in which law enforcement and civic leaders sought to tamp down expectations that the department would announce major revelations about the death of Mr. Gray, who was black — much less a decision on whether to bring criminal charges. “I think people had expectations that were unrealistic,” Gov. Larry Hogan said in a visit to West Baltimore. “We all want answers, but they’ve got to be patient.” The leader of the police union, Gene Ryan, president of the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police, objected to protesters who he said “have already tried and convicted the officers.” and have greeted the rest of the force with what he said was undeserved hostility. “They haven’t been charged, No. 1,” Mr. Ryan said. “No. 2, they still get their day in court. So, how can they request that they be put in jail?” As for the Police Department, Mr. Batts said: “This does not mean that the investigation is over. If new evidence is found, we will follow it. If new direction is given by the state’s attorney, we will obey it.” Police commanders said more than 30 detectives, operating on an unusually swift timetable, had been working on the investigation. That included reviewing every available video that might show anything about what happened to Mr. Gray the day he was arrested, from closed-circuit security camera images to cellphone video, Mr. Davis said. Officers riding bicycles arrested Mr. Gray in the 1700 block of Presbury Street, in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood of northwest Baltimore. They charged him with illegal possession of a switchblade knife, and called a van to take him to the Western District police station. Continue reading the main story The Police Department on Thursday raised to 98 the count of officers injured since rioters began throwing rocks and bottles, setting fires and looting Monday afternoon. Captain Kowalczyk said 43 officers had been treated at emergency rooms, including three who remain on medical leave, and 15 who have returned to work but are limited to light duty. Rallies also took place in Cincinnati and Philadelphia. In Philadelphia, a multiracial crowd of about 1,000 people gathered in front of City Hall Thursday afternoon to hear speeches in support of the Baltimore protesters. As police helicopters largely drowned out the speeches of organizers, participants held up handwritten signs including “Killer Cops Modern Lynchers” and “Philly is Baltimore.” One of the participants,Rahman Wortman, 24, a Temple University student, said he was disappointed that earlier protests had not stopped police brutality. “If it was effective, we wouldn’t need events like this,” he said. The march began quietly but became increasingly volatile as the police and demonstrators jostled one another, plastic bottles were thrown at the police and mounted officers charged toward angry demonstrators. \nAlan Blinder reported from Baltimore, and Richard Pérez-Peña from New York.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story BALTIMORE — Medical examiners on Friday delivered an autopsy report on Freddie Gray, who died of an injury sustained in police custody, to Baltimore’s chief prosecutor, Marilyn J. Mosby, as the focus in the case shifts squarely to her. The office of the state chief medical examiner said it would not make its findings public, leaving that decision up to Ms. Mosby, the state’s attorney. She called a news conference for 10:30 a.m. Ms. Mosby takes on the case able to draw on relatively little experience, but with the support of many of the city’s black leaders and prominent police critics. “Whatever judgment she comes up with, I will accept it — I have that much faith in her,” Representative Elijah E. Cummings told CNN on Friday morning. “Her integrity is impeccable.” The Police Department completed its initial investigation into Mr. Gray’s death and also handed its findings to Ms Mosby’s office, on Thursday. Prosecutors added the police work to their own investigation, and Commissioner Anthony W. Batts said his department will now take direction from them about what leads to pursue. That put Ms. Mosby, in office for less than four months, on the hot seat. She has the leading role in determining what happened to Mr. Gray, and whether to pursue criminal charges against police officers. That could be a political tightrope walk in a city roiled by civil unrest, with thousands of demonstrators demanding police reform and punishment. But some of the most prominent figures making those demands, like Mr. Cummings, have also expressed high confidence in Ms. Mosby, 35, who is married to a city councilman and has other ties to the city’s political establishment. William H. Murphy, Jr., the prominent lawyer and former judge representing Mr. Gray’s family, has also voiced confidence in her judgment in the case, and the mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, has asked the public to be patient and give Ms. Mosby time to do her job. Last year, Mr. Murphy endorsed Ms. Mosby, helping her achieve an upset win over an incumbent state’s attorney. Demonstrations continued in Baltimore on Thursday night, but the city was fairly quiet, in contrast to the violence that broke out earlier in the week. With thousands of National Guard troops and officers from outside police forces patrolling the streets, people largely observed the 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew imposed on Monday. On Thursday, the police revealed that the van officers used to carry Mr. Gray after he was arrested on April 12 made a previously undisclosed stop en route to a police station. The new stop turned up on video taken from “a privately owned camera,” said the deputy police commissioner, Kevin Davis. He added that it was “previously unknown to us,” but he did not elaborate. His statement suggested that no police officers told investigators about the stop. Six officers have been suspended with pay over the death of Mr. Gray, who suffered a fatal injury to his neck while in police custody. Asked later if the commanders were saying that officers had lied or covered something up, a Police Department spokesman, Capt. J. Eric Kowalczyk, said, “It would be inappropriate for us to further comment.” Continue reading the main story In a statement, Ms. Mosby said: “While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified. We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.” Several news organizations reported Thursday and Friday that according to law enforcement sources, Mr. Gray suffered a head injury while in the police van. The Police Department declined to confirm or deny that, but it has acknowledged that Mr. Gray had not been wearing a seatbelt, contrary to policy, and that he should have received medical treatment sooner. In a sometimes defensive appearance on Thursday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake offered a rebuttal to criticism that she was not sensitive enough to the city’s poor and had not done enough to rein in police misconduct. Referring to herself, Ms. Mosby and the nation’s new attorney general, Loretta E. Lynch, the mayor said, “If, with the nation watching, three black women at three different levels can’t get justice and healing for this community, you tell me where we’re going to get it in our country.” The Police Department handed over its findings to prosecutors a day ahead of the May 1 deadline the police commissioner, Anthony W. Batts, had set. They arrived after days in which law enforcement and civic leaders sought to tamp down expectations that the department would announce major revelations about the death of Mr. Gray, who was black — much less a decision on whether to bring criminal charges. “I think people had expectations that were unrealistic,” Gov. Larry Hogan said in a visit to West Baltimore. “We all want answers, but they’ve got to be patient.” The leader of the police union, Gene Ryan, president of the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police, objected to protesters who he said “have already tried and convicted the officers.” and have greeted the rest of the force with what he said was undeserved hostility. “They haven’t been charged, No. 1,” Mr. Ryan said. “No. 2, they still get their day in court. So, how can they request that they be put in jail?” As for the Police Department, Mr. Batts said: “This does not mean that the investigation is over. If new evidence is found, we will follow it. If new direction is given by the state’s attorney, we will obey it.” Police commanders said more than 30 detectives, operating on an unusually swift timetable, had been working on the investigation. That included reviewing every available video that might show anything about what happened to Mr. Gray the day he was arrested, from closed-circuit security camera images to cellphone video, Mr. Davis said. Officers riding bicycles arrested Mr. Gray in the 1700 block of Presbury Street, in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood of northwest Baltimore. They charged him with illegal possession of a switchblade knife, and called a van to take him to the Western District police station. Continue reading the main story The Police Department on Thursday raised to 98 the count of officers injured since rioters began throwing rocks and bottles, setting fires and looting Monday afternoon. Captain Kowalczyk said 43 officers had been treated at emergency rooms, including three who remain on medical leave, and 15 who have returned to work but are limited to light duty. Rallies also took place in Cincinnati and Philadelphia. In Philadelphia, a multiracial crowd of about 1,000 people gathered in front of City Hall Thursday afternoon to hear speeches in support of the Baltimore protesters. As police helicopters largely drowned out the speeches of organizers, participants held up handwritten signs including “Killer Cops Modern Lynchers” and “Philly is Baltimore.” One of the participants,Rahman Wortman, 24, a Temple University student, said he was disappointed that earlier protests had not stopped police brutality. “If it was effective, we wouldn’t need events like this,” he said. The march began quietly but became increasingly volatile as the police and demonstrators jostled one another, plastic bottles were thrown at the police and mounted officers charged toward angry demonstrators. \nAlan Blinder reported from Baltimore, and Richard Pérez-Peña from New York.

      "title": "Mayor De Blasio Defends Police Response to Freddie Gray Protests in New York",
      "text": "APRIL 30, 2015 Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, convened a news conference after hearing complaints about the police response from allies like the Rev. Al Sharpton. “I’ve participated in plenty of protests, on plenty of issues,” the mayor said. “I believe deeply in how nonviolent protest has achieved social change.” Photo Many marched to protest the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Credit Michael Appleton for The New York Times But, he added: “When the police give you instruction, you follow the instruction. It’s not debatable.” The arrests on Wednesday, which prompted a protest from liberal groups outside Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan, came amid a renewed debate in New York over aggressive police tactics, including an effort by the City Council to decriminalize low-level offenses, like public urination. But Mr. de Blasio’s attitude was a far cry from late last year, when he allowed similar demonstrations to spill into the city’s highways and avenues. That episode, after a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict an officer in the death of a Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, contributed to an open law enforcement rebellion against the mayor. On Thursday, as in the past on police issues, Mr. de Blasio seemed to struggle to walk a tightrope. Even as Mr. Bratton, in a separate news conference, acknowledged a “much more assertive” approach to handling street protests, the mayor insisted that “the strategic approach is exactly the same.” But the mayor eventually allowed that some “tactical adjustments” had been made in response to past cases in which officers had been injured, including a march across the Brooklyn Bridge. The result was a strained, and at times testy display by a mayor trying to balance liberal sympathies with the burdens of overseeing a police force whose tactics he once criticized. Mr. de Blasio grew visibly frustrated at the notion that the police in Union Square had been too aggressive with protesters, telling reporters, “If you guys want to sensationalize, if you think that’s your contribution to society, feel free.” Photo Police arrested 143 demonstrators. Credit Michael Appleton for The New York Times He lamented that the news media did not focus on what he cited as his accomplishments in police reform, like a drop in civilian complaints against the Police Department.   In a telling shift, Mr. de Blasio rebuked his interlocutors for suggesting that some of the protesters arrested on Wednesday had done little to provoke a tough police response. In December, after the Garner protests, he lashed out at a journalist who suggested that some protesters had acted violently. To the city’s liberal advocates — some of whom had marched alongside Mr. de Blasio during his candidate days — the mayor’s response was disappointing. “All I heard was, ‘Listen to the police, do what the police say,’ ” said Gideon Oliver, a civil rights lawyer who represents a group that organized the rally. “If the mayor’s answer to problems of abuse of police discretion is ‘just listen to what police say,’ that’s obviously a very big problem.” Still, Mr. Bratton and police officials were adamant that they had acted appropriately to rein in a demonstration that was threatening to become unruly and disrupt the city’s evening rush. “Throughout the night we were extremely flexible,” Chief James P. O’Neill said at the Police Academy in Queens. “If the protests continue, we will continue to be flexible. It’s not just one strategy.” Chief O’Neill added that one precinct captain, the commander of the 13th Precinct in Manhattan, had been struck in the head with a stick. “He’s got a nice cut on his jaw,” he said. Photo Some protesters sought to block traffic. Credit Michael Abbott/Getty Images One veteran city supervisor, who was at Union Square on Wednesday, said he had been told at the onset that the police might take a more assertive approach than in past protests. “They were free to protest on the sidewalk, and follow the law, and we would certainly let them express their rights,” said the supervisor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to detail department policies. “But if they broke the law, went into the street and stuff like that, we weren’t going to give them much and were going to start locking people up.” Aside from the arrests, the supervisor said, the night went smoothly. “No major fights,” he said. “No major assaults on cops, or cops doing anything crazy to anyone else.” Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday that the city would not take an “ironclad” approach to future protests, and would consider each demonstration case by case. “It’s a big, complicated city,” the mayor said. “I have confidence, having been a public servant, having been a protester, that the N.Y.P.D. knows how to work out every situation.” A reporter pointed out that Mr. de Blasio himself had been arrested during his run for mayor, as a show of civil disobedience to protest the closing of a public hospital in Brooklyn. The mayor scoffed and said there was no comparison to what transpired on Wednesday night. His own arrest, Mr. de Blasio said, “was the most choreographed thing on earth.” Correction: April 30, 2015 An earlier version of this article misstated where Chief James P. O’Neill spoke on Thursday about the Police Department’s response to protests in Manhattan. He was at the Police Academy in Queens, not Police Headquarters. \nMatt Flegenheimer, J. David Goodman and Benjamin Mueller contributed reporting.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story MADRID — A royal battle is simmering here. On one side is the Prado, a renowned repository of art and a showcase of Spanish culture that draws huge numbers of tourists. On the other is a brash newcomer, emerging onto the scene in layers of gray granite from a hillside near the baroque royal palace of Spanish kings. In advance of its opening, the upstart, the Museum of Royal Collections, is insisting that the Prado surrender four paintings, including its top two attractions — “The Garden of Earthly Delights” by Hieronymous Bosch and a sumptuous 15th-century depiction of the descent of Christ from the cross by Rogier van der Weyden. The Prado’s response to the demand, by the president of the country’s public heritage agency, was unequivocal. “If he is waiting to have the paintings in his place, he has to wait until hell freezes over,” the chairman of the Prado’s board, José Pedro Pérez-Llorca, said in a public declaration this week. The disputed paintings were removed from the royal San Lorenzo de El Escorial monastery and placed for safekeeping with the Prado by the government authorities during the Spanish Civil War, almost 80 years ago. But now the Patrimonio Nacional, the heritage agency that administers all royal holdings, from palaces to antique yachts to artworks it has lent over the years, wants them back for display at its new museum. Photo “The Garden of Earthly Delights,” by Hieronymus Bosch, is the other top attraction at the Prado, in Madrid. Museums throughout Spain are watching the tug of war with great interest, fearful that pieces among their holdings that have a royal provenance could be pulled next. The heritage agency, led by José Rodríguez-Spiteri, its president, has about 1,000 works at other museums and has already recalled several. The agency’s president has signaled his interest in calling back works by El Greco, Velázquez and Goya that had been out on loan. “I’m sure it’s a very good project, but to create this new museum, is it necessary to dismantle another one that is the most important in Spain?” said Pepe Serra, the director of the National Museum of Art of Catalonia, which earlier this year willingly gave up a religious painting by Anton Raphael Mengs that was on loan from the Patrimonio so it could be used in the new museum. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story This is not the first time that museums here have fought over ownership of art. In one high-profile case, the Prado in 2010 unsuccessfully sought to reclaim Picasso’s “Guernica” from the nearby Reina Sofía Museum in Madrid. The heritage agency’s request for the paintings is a financial calculation. Cultural institutions in Spain have endured deep cuts in state subsidies, and the Patrimonio Nacional was no exception. After spending 158 million euros about $178 million — in public money on the new museum, which is scheduled to open in the fall of 2016, the Patrimonio Nacional is hoping to entice more visitors by sprinkling some star attractions among the 150,000 works in the royal collection. “It’s an extremely exhausting type of work, because you are always under pressure to offer interesting, dramatic pieces of art so that your citizens are interested,” said Mr. Rodríguez-Spiteri, who provoked the dispute after concluding that the new museum could not draw enough visitors with only royal objects. Continue reading the main story “You cannot put a row of the most fantastic tapestries or a row of carriages or a row of armor, and settle with that,” he said. There is no doubt that the works belong to the royal collection of the Patrimonio Nacional; the Prado even lists them as being on temporary loan. The van der Weyden painting was acquired by Maria of Hungary, who left it to her nephew King Philip II. In 1574, it was given to the Escorial monastery, where it remained for 362 years until it was moved to the Prado in 1936. Photo The upstart Museum of the Royal Collections of Madrid, under construction, is to open in fall 2016. Credit Santi Palacios for The New York Times The Bosch work, an ambitious symbol-laden tryptich by the Dutch medieval painter, was acquired by King Philip II and presented in 1593 to Escorial, where it hung until it was sent to the Prado for restoration in 1933 and then put on loan in 1936 for safekeeping. But the paintings are in the Prado’s possession, and it has forcefully pressed an emotional claim, as well as its trump card as the most popular museum in Madrid, with 2.5 million visitors last year. The stricken face of the Virgin Mary from the disputed painting by van der Weyden is plastered all over the city for a new exhibition there, including on an enormous advertisement at Madrid’s airport. ”To deprive the Prado of those paintings would be something akin to a crime,” Mr. Pérez-Llorca, a lawyer and former minister of foreign affairs, said in an interview. “The Prado is a Spanish jewel, and these paintings enrich the museum.” Mr. Rodríguez-Spiteri, a former ambassador to Portugal and Germany, demanded the paintings last summer. The struggle between the institutions has gone on ever since, and high-level government officials have been drawn in. As for the royal family, it has stayed out of the fray. A spokesman declined to comment and referred all questions to the Patrimonio Nacional. “The royal family always avoids interfering in political fights,” said Ana Romero Galán, a journalist and author of “End-Game,” about the abdication of King Juan Carlos I last year in favor of his son, Felipe VI. The royal museum’s opening was originally intended to coincide with what was to be the 40th anniversary of Juan Carlos’s reign next year. The Spanish deputy prime minister Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría has said that the dispute is over and that the paintings will not move. But if that is so, it’s apparently not evident to the two bickering institutions. Photo José Rodríguez-Spiteri, president of the country's public heritage agency, is insisting that the Prado surrender four paintings, including its top two attractions. Credit Santi Palacios for The New York Times When the Prado mounted an exhibition last fall devoted to the Italian sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the Patrimonio Nacional declined to loan seven works, claiming concerns about travel risks. And the director of the new royal collection museum, José Luís Díez, once a Prado curator, was criticized by his former colleagues there when a Patrimonio Nacional web page included the four disputed paintings on a list of its top masterworks . The two institutions seemed to reach a public rapprochement with the Prado’s van der Weyden show , which included the artist’s “Calvary,” newly restored in a five-year joint project with the agency, which owns it. A high-ranking Patrimonio official attended the exhibition’s opening in late March. Continue reading the main story But in the last few weeks, tensions surfaced again as the Patrimonio offered previews of its museum, designed to blend with the architecture of the palace and organized around the members of the Hapsburg and Bourbon families who acquired the artifacts. On a tour of the site, the museum’s director, Mr. Luís Díez, showed off a vast gallery that he said had originally been intended for a royal carriage exhibition. The plan was scrapped, he said, because the show would not “reflect the high quality of the royal collection, nor the importance of the museum.” Soon after the preview, Mr. Rodríguez-Spiteri declared in the nation’s leading newspaper, El País, that the four disputed paintings were essential “to the future” of the new museum. The latest skirmish occurred when the Prado sought to extend the popular van der Weyden exhibition a month beyond its scheduled closing, on June 28. But its request to prolong the loan of the newly restored “Calvary” painting was refused. In recent days, a series of government meetings took place to try to work out a solution, perhaps by clarifying the legal status of works on loan to the Prado or making another swap. Alternatives have been floated, such as rotating the four works between the two museums. Mr. Pérez-Llorca said the Prado would not compromise. Among his concerns is that acquiescence will open a Pandora’s box of claims. “It is not private property; they belong to the public,” he said. “To deprive the museum because of a whim would begin the dismantling of the Prado.” Loading...

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Ben E. King, the smooth, soulful baritone who led the Drifters on “There Goes My Baby,” “Save the Last Dance for Me” and other hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and as a solo artist recorded the classic singles “Spanish Harlem” and “Stand by Me,” died on Thursday in Hackensack, N.J. He was 76. His lawyer, Judy Tint, said Mr. King, who lived in Teaneck, N.J., died at Hackensack University Medical Center after a brief illness, which she did not specify. Mr. King was working in his father’s Harlem luncheonette in 1956 when a local impresario, Lover Patterson, overheard him singing to himself and persuaded him to join a group he managed, the Five Crowns. Lightning struck when the group, then known as the Crowns, performed at the Apollo Theater on a bill with the original Drifters in 1958 and attracted the attention of George Treadwell, who managed the Drifters and owned the name. Mr. Treadwell had been feuding with his group, which had entered a lean period after Clyde McPhatter, its lead singer, was drafted into the Army in late 1954. He fired the Drifters en masse and replaced them with Mr. King and three of his fellow singers. Atlantic Records assigned the songwriting team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller to produce the group’s recordings. The match turned out to be inspired, yielding a streak of hit records that helped the Drifters achieve crossover success. Mr. King’s suave but impassioned vocals had a lot to do with it. “He had a way of retaining a gospel grit in his voice but at the same had an easy, debonair style that was appealing and ingratiating,” said Ken Emerson, the author of “Always Magic in the Air: The Bomp and Brilliance of the Brill Building Era,” about the Midtown Manhattan center of pop music songwriting. Continue reading the main story Video by BlackAsWhite1 “There Goes My Baby,” released in 1959, reached No. 2 on the pop charts. It was followed by “Dance With Me,” “This Magic Moment,” “I Count the Tears,” “Lonely Winds” and “Save the Last Dance for Me,” a No. 1 hit. Mr. King left the Drifters in 1960 and embarked on a successful solo career. “Spanish Harlem,” written by Mr. Leiber with Phil Spector, reached the Top 10 that year. “Stand by Me,” which Mr. King helped write, reached the Top 10 in 1961 and again in 1986, when it was used in the soundtrack of the Rob Reiner film of the same name. “Because he recorded the work of so many great songwriters, his own songwriting is often overlooked,” Mr. Emerson said. “But he co-wrote ‘There Goes My Baby,’ and ‘Stand by Me’ originated with him.” He was also the principal writer of “Dance With Me.” Rolling Stone ranked “Stand by Me” 122nd on its list of the 500 greatest songs. In 1999 BMI, the music licensing organization, announced that it was the fourth-most-recorded song of the 20th century, having been played more than seven million times on radio and television. Continue reading the main story Video by dannypsych Mr. King was born Benjamin Earl Nelson on Sept. 28, 1938, in Henderson, N.C., and grew up in Harlem, where his father had moved the family when he was a child. He took the surname King, which belonged to a favorite uncle, soon after joining the Drifters. Continue reading the main story He began singing in church choirs and during high school formed a doo-wop group, the Four B’s, that occasionally performed at the Apollo. “To me, singing was fun,” he said in a 1993 interview with the website Classic Bands . “I never even visualized for a second doing what I’m doing.” Mr. King was similarly offhand in describing his songwriting. In an interview with Bill Millar, the author of “The Drifters: The Rise and Fall of the Black Vocal Group” (1971), he said, “I’d sit down with this old guitar I have that’s missing all but three strings — no one else could play it, but I pick out tunes, and, when I have something, I’ll play it for someone who can write it.” He was singing with the Five Crowns when, in 1958, the group signed with R&B Records, a fledgling label run by the songwriters Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman. As the Crowns, the group recorded one song, “Kiss and Make Up,” before the company went out of business. The relationship proved fruitful, however. Pomus and Shuman went on to write “This Magic Moment” with Mr. King, as well as “Save the Last Dance for Me.” Recording for Atco, a subsidiary of Atlantic, Mr. King scored modest successes in the 1960s with “Don’t Play That Song (You Lied),” “I (Who Have Nothing),” “Seven Letters” and “Tears, Tears, Tears.” In 1968, he performed on the single “Soul Meeting,” a minor hit for the Soul Clan, an Atlantic supergroup whose members also included Solomon Burke and Joe Tex. By the end of the decade his career was in decline. He rebounded with the 1975 funk hit “Supernatural Thing, Part 1,” and in 1977 recorded a well-regarded album with the Average White Band, “Benny and Us.” He continued to turn out albums for Atlantic into the 1980s, recording “Let Me Live in Your Life” (1978), “Music Trance” (1980) and “Street Tough” (1981). Mr. King later recorded for a variety of independent labels and performed regularly in clubs and small concert halls in the United States and abroad. He is survived by his mother, Jenny Nelson; his wife, Betty King; two daughters, Terris Cannon and Angela Matos; a son, Benjamin Jr.; six grandchildren; four sisters, and three brothers. “I still think my whole career was accidental,” Mr. King told Classic Bands. “I didn’t pursue it. I feel like I’m cheating sometimes.” \nDaniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting. Loading...",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is scrambling for reassurances it can present this month at a Camp David summit meeting to persuade Arab allies that the United States has their backs, despite a pending nuclear deal with Iran . Officials at the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department have been meeting to discuss everything from joint training missions for American and Arab militaries (more likely) to additional weapons sales to a loose defense pact that could signal that the United States would back those allies if they come under attack from Iran. Over mahi-mahi at a dinner at the Pentagon two weeks ago, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter polled a select group of Middle East experts for advice on how the administration could placate Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and Qatar , all of which fear the nuclear deal, according to several attendees at the dinner. Mr. Carter wanted to know “how do you make clear to the G.C.C. that America isn’t going to hand the house keys of the Persian Gulf over to Iran and then pivot to Asia?” said one Middle East expert at the dinner, using the acronym for the Gulf Cooperation Council. The council includes Bahrain, Kuwait , Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. On April 20, during lunch with President Obama at the White House, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, pressed for a defense pact with the United States, according to a senior administration official. The president in turn sought support from the Emirates for the Iran nuclear deal, which Secretary of State John Kerry is negotiating. Administration officials said Mr. Obama had not settled on what to offer but that there were several possible options, most of them difficult to pull off. A security treaty with Saudi Arabia and the other countries is unlikely because that would have to be ratified by Congress and would probably run into opposition from Israel and its supporters on Capitol Hill. But instead of a full-fledged security treaty — like the one the United States has with Japan ensuring that America will come to Japan’s defense — the administration is discussing offering a looser, less-binding defense pact. In the deal envisioned, American officials would put in writing, but not send to Congress, language agreeing to the defense of Arab allies if they come under attack from outside forces. Such a pact would not apply if the governments came under attack from political opponents within their own countries, since the last thing the administration wants is to get involved in future uprisings like the Arab Spring. There is not much time left to come up with something. Mr. Kerry is to meet next week with the foreign ministers of the Arab countries to prepare for the Camp David summit meeting on May 14, and he will be expected to foreshadow what kind of package the administration is willing to offer. If he does not have anything that satisfies the gulf allies, they may downgrade their attendance at the Camp David meeting. Saudi Arabia, for example, could send its crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, instead of King Salman, in what would widely be interpreted as a rebuff of Mr. Obama. Continue reading the main story Another option the administration is considering is whether to make Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates “major non-NATO allies,” a designation that would loosen up restrictions on weapons sales. The designation falls short of a defense pact but does grant a number of military advantages that are available only to NATO allies. Bahrain and Kuwait are already designated as such allies. Former President George W. Bush gave Kuwait the status in 2004 after it supported the American-led invasion of Iraq and served as a staging ground for United States troops. Bahrain, the home of the United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet, got the designation in 2002. But neither Saudi Arabia nor the United Arab Emirates has the designation that could help soothe Arab fears, said Kenneth M. Pollack, an expert on Middle East political and military affairs at the Brookings Institution. “The gulf states are very concerned about this nuclear deal with Iran,’’ Mr. Pollack said. “Some of them believe this is the start of an Obama administration bid to trade them away.” Administration officials, he said, were “trying to think creatively about how they can assuage those fears.” Increased weapons sales could help, but there is a major roadblock: maintaining Israel’s military edge. The United States has long put restrictions on the types of weapons that American defense firms can sell to Arab nations, which are meant to ensure that Israel keeps a military advantage against its traditional adversaries in the region. That is why the administration has so far not allowed Lockheed Martin to sell the F-35 fighter jet , considered to be the jewel of America’s future arsenal of weapons, to Arab countries. The plane, the world’s most expensive weapons project, has stealth abilities and has been approved for sale to Israel. Defense analysts say that with the balance of power in the Middle East in flux, that could change. One possibility would be to wait three years after delivering the F-35 to Israel and then approve it for sale to the United Arab Emirates — the Arab ally most likely to get the first chance to buy the stealth fighter — which would give Israel a three-year head start. If the Arab allies “could push a button and have anything, they want a security pact, a Japan-style treaty,” said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “ But they’re cognizant of the fact that that’s too big of an ask. So at the very minimum, it’s weapons sales.” Vali R. Nasr, a former special adviser to Mr. Obama who is now dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said that the administration had already made moves to reassure the Arab allies — most notably by supporting Saudi-led airstrikes against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and by moving an aircraft carrier group to the Yemeni coast. The warships were meant as a show of force to turn back an Iranian convoy, which American officials said they suspected was trying to deliver weapons to the Houthis. “Remember, our dog in the fight in Yemen is Al Qaeda, not the Houthis,” Mr. Nasr said. Moving the carrier group to back the Saudis “wasn’t about Yemen. It was about alliance management. “ Loading...",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story For the second time in five years, Sergey Aleynikov was convicted on charges of stealing confidential computer trading code from his former employer, Goldman Sachs . The first time it took a federal jury just hours to convict; this time it came after more than a week of deliberation and an accusation of “food poisoning” and avocado tampering in a state court jury room. A jury on Friday convicted Mr. Aleynikov on one of the counts he faced but found him not guilty on another. They deadlocked on a third count against Mr. Aleynikov, who smiled nervously after the decision was announced. The split verdict — a striking conclusion to a case that divided the legal world, inspired a best-selling book and spotlighted the secret formulas behind high-frequency trading on Wall Street — came after the case nearly ended in what would have been the most bizarre of mistrials. The prospect of a mistrial stemmed from a dispute between two jurors deciding Mr. Aleynikov’s fate, with a female juror accusing a male one of “food tampering” — in part because an avocado was missing from her sandwich. The female juror also said she had taken a blood test to determine whether she was poisoned, turning the criminal proceedings into a culinary whodunit. Continue reading the main story Timeline: High Frequency Trading Trial But the judge overseeing the case, Justice Daniel P. Conviser of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, called her accusations “completely unfounded.” And after he dismissed the feuding jurors — and Mr. Aleynikov’s lawyer, Kevin Marino, dropped his request for a mistrial — both sides agreed to continue with a 10-member jury. Their verdict handed a partial victory to the Manhattan district attorney’s office in one of its most prominent financial cases in recent memory. With the conviction, prosecutors avoided what would have been an embarrassing defeat as it pursues an even bigger white-collar criminal trial: that of three former Dewey & LeBoeuf executives accused of concealing the law firm’s dire financial situation from investors. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The outcome of Mr. Aleynikov’s case raised questions about the decision by Mr. Marino and his client to roll the dice with the smaller jury. He could have objected to the remaining jurors, which would have either thrown the case into a mistrial or at least laid the groundwork for an appeal. According to people close to the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Mr. Marino and even some prosecutors suspected that the remaining jurors were prepared to acquit, which in hindsight was a miscalculation. In any other case, a conviction after near mistrial by food fight might seem something that only Hollywood could dream up. But in the on-again, off-again legal odyssey that is the People v. Aleynikov, it was merely the latest in a long line of peculiar twists. Mr. Aleynikov, a 45-year-old former Goldman software programmer who was born in Russia and is now a dual citizen in the United States, was first arrested on July 3, 2009. His conviction, which came at the hands of federal prosecutors in Manhattan, was overturned in 2012 by an appeals court, which ruled that the case had misapplied the corporate espionage laws against him. Continue reading the main story But the Manhattan district attorney’s office took up the case anew and eventually charged Mr. Aleynikov under state laws, drawing an outcry from defense lawyers who complained about prosecutorial overkill. Then, a state judge tossed out much of the prosecution’s evidence, ruling that the F.B.I. had conducted an “illegal” search and arrest of Mr. Aleynikov. Mr. Aleynikov, who lost his job and marriage in the fallout from the case, has become something of a cause célèbre in legal and media circles. Michael Lewis wrote a sympathetic profile of Mr. Aleynikov in Vanity Fair and later adapted the article into the best-selling book “Flash Boys” about high-frequency trading. For Mr. Aleynikov, who rejected a plea deal that would have spared him prison time, the verdict is a huge blow but not a dead end. A federal appeals court overturned his conviction once before, ruling that federal prosecutors had misapplied the corporate espionage laws against him, and a state appeals court could do the same. Justice Conviser has also signaled some skepticism about the case and left open the possibility that he might throw out a conviction, a rare step that takes place when a judge concludes that a verdict is legally invalid. The judge said he would take about five weeks to make his decision. Even if the conviction stands, Judge Conviser might exercise some leniency in sentencing. Mr. Aleynikov could face up to a few years in prison, though no minimum sentence is required. Mr. Marino is likely to emphasize that Mr. Aleynikov already served one year in federal prison in Fort Dix, N.J., before the appeals court vacated his conviction. The thrust of the case against Mr. Aleynikov, a bespectacled computer whiz who cuts a gaunt figure in the shadow of Mr. Marino’s football build, has not changed from federal to state court. Like federal prosecutors, the Manhattan district attorney’s office focused on Mr. Aleynikov’s decision to download proprietary Goldman source code before leaving the bank for a high-frequency trading firm in Chicago. He downloaded the code to a server in Germany and then to his own computer. To cover his tracks, Mr. Aleynikov tried to delete the history of commands on his Goldman computer. Mr. Marino did not challenge the underlying facts of the case. Instead, he said they added up not to a crime but to a simple breach of Goldman’s confidentiality policy. “There’s no doubt Mr. Aleynikov did something wrong,” he told the jury, stopping occasionally to sip from a water bottle he clutched to throughout the closing statement. “But this is a very badly misguided case.” A theatrical performer with a booming voice and a knack for hyperbole, Mr. Marino once shouted in open court that the case against Mr. Aleynikov was “a wild thing,” saying that prosecutors failed to establish the basic elements of the crimes they charged. He argued that Mr. Aleynikov did not profit from the code or deprive Goldman of economic gain, “essential elements” that the prosecution needed to prove. Continue reading the main story Mr. Marino, who called only two witnesses of his own, also emphasized that Mr. Aleynikov did not make a “tangible” reproduction of the files, a requirement for proving unlawful use of secret scientific material, which the jury ultimately convicted him on. The decades-old criminal statute had baffled jurors from the start of the deliberations, with the panel sending several notes to Justice Conviser seeking clarity on the meaning of the law, echoing a debate at trial over whether computer code was “tangible.” “Can you taste it?” Mr. Marino asked an F.B.I. agent who arrested Mr. Aleynikov. “I don’t think so,” the agent replied. Over the course of the trial, Mr. Marino benefited from some favorable judicial rulings. On what was supposed to be the first day of trial, Justice Conviser refused the prosecution’s request to delay the start for several weeks. Weeks later, the judge ruled that prosecutors could not call an expert witness because they failed to provide Mr. Marino adequate time to prepare. Daniel Holmes, a Manhattan assistant district attorney, made up some of that lost ground with a compelling closing argument. In the nearly 90-minute address — delivered to a courtroom packed with spectators — Mr. Holmes implored the jurors to use their “common sense.” “He may have regretted getting caught, but there’s no indication he regretted his actions,” Mr. Holmes said. Despite the long deliberations, signs of juror tension did not emerge until Tuesday. And even now, the exact nature of the avocado dispute is something of a mystery. Although the dispute was unforeseeable, Mr. Marino’s closing argument included a prophetic analogy to food. The prosecution failed to deliver the goods, he said, likening their case to promising to “bring 50 pizzas to a pool party and you show up with hamburgers.” On Monday, when the avocado dispute occurred, the jurors ordered lunch from Mon Cher market, which charges a dollar extra for avocado on sandwiches. Later on, jurors were on their own for lunch. But by Thursday, the court was back to ordering from Mon Cher. Loading... ",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story BALTIMORE — Marilyn J. Mosby, the prosecutor who on Friday announced criminal charges against six police officers in the death of Freddie Gray, took office only four months ago, elected here with the backing of community activists who viewed her as aggressive in taking on police misconduct. At 35, Ms. Mosby — whose formal title is the Maryland state’s attorney for the city of Baltimore — is the youngest prosecutor in any major American city. Her dramatic announcement on Friday seemed to stun people here and thrust her immediately into the national spotlight, not only for the hard-hitting language she used in describing the behavior of the officers, but also for the way she directly addressed public anger over the death of Mr. Gray. “To the people of Baltimore and the demonstrators across America, I heard your call for ‘no justice, no peace,’” Ms. Mosby said. “Your peace is sincerely needed as I work to deliver justice on behalf of this young man, those that are angry or hurt or have their own experience of injustice.” As she ran for office last fall, Ms. Mosby vowed to be tougher on violent criminals and also more aggressive on police misconduct. People like Tawanda Jones, whose brother Tyrone West was killed after a violent scuffle with police, campaigned forcefully for her — in part, Ms. Jones said, to get rid of her predecessor, Gregg L. Bernstein. “I would have been a supporter of anybody to get him out of that chair,” Ms. Jones, who has been protesting police treatment of black men here since her brother died, said in an interview. “I was trying to get anybody that would take this seriously.” She said that after watching Ms. Mosby, she became convinced that she would. “I’m so happy, I’m so excited I can’t stop crying,” Ms. Jones said Friday, moments after Ms. Mosby’s announcement, which she saw on television while working at the preschool where she teaches. “She gave us her word. I said, ‘How will you handle police brutality?’ She said, ‘If you put me in this chair, I don’t care if they are in uniform or not. I come from a family of officers. Some are good, some are bad, I will hold everybody accountable to the law.’ And thank you, Jesus, she lived it out.” Aside from her family background in law enforcement, Ms. Mosby has other personal ties to justice issues. When she was growing up in Boston, a 17-year-old cousin was mistaken for a drug dealer and killed outside her home by another 17-year-old. She has been outspoken about the need to hold police officers accountable. While she was running for office, in response to a Baltimore Sun investigation into allegations of police beatings, she said: “Police brutality is completely inexcusable. I’m going to apply justice fairly, even to those who wear a badge.” Ms. Mosby is married to Nick Mosby, a Baltimore city councilman, which drew calls from the police union for her to recuse herself. She dismissed those calls on Friday at her news conference. Continue reading the main story “I uphold the laws. He makes the laws,” she said. “And I will prosecute any case within my jurisdiction.” Ms. Mosby comes from a long line of law enforcement officers. Her father, mother and grandfather were police officers, and her grandfather, she said, was a founding member of the first association for black police officers in Massachusetts — a point she underscored on Friday in comments directed at the Baltimore force. “To the rank-and-file officers,” she said, “please know that the accusations against these six officers are not an indictment of the entire force.” Sonia Kumar, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, said, “Her actions really told us who she is today.” “For years and years, victims of police violence in our city, overwhelmingly black people, have sought justice for their loved ones to no avail,” Ms. Kumar said. “This is an historic moment.” Loading...

      "text": " LAS VEGAS — By now, even people who do not follow boxing know that two men named Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr. are due to fight an important match here on Saturday. But does anyone — boxing fans included — know what they are fighting for?\n“Um, I saw the big belt, so I know it’s a championship fight,” said Mike Behner, a 66-year-old construction company owner, referring to the emerald-encrusted championship belt displayed here this week by the World Boxing Council. “But I don’t know if it’s the world championship or the U.S. championship, or even if there is such a thing. I just know that whoever wins gets the belt.”\nAs big as a Frisbee in a dollar store and a million times as expensive, the belt is a thing of gaudy wonder, even by boxing’s inflated standards. The World Boxing Council sounds pretty impressive, too, with its fancy, authoritative name.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage This Ring Is Anything but Ornate, Yet All Eyes Will Be on It Anyway APRIL 30, 2015 As Floyd Mayweather Jr. Steps Into Ring, He Turns It Into a Catwalk MAY 1, 2015 In Mayweather-Pacquiao Buildup, Surprisingly Little Fight in the Fighters APRIL 30, 2015 On Boxing: Mayweather-Pacquiao Is an Easy Sell; Boxing Isn’t APRIL 28, 2015 TV Sports: A Pay-Per-View Knockout Unites Two Rival Networks APRIL 27, 2015 After He Beat Floyd Mayweather Jr., They Said, O.K., Now Do It Again APRIL 24, 2015 With a Big Payday at Stake, Mayweather May Have to Play Offense APRIL 25, 2015 The Logistics Behind Mayweather and Pacquiao’s 60-40 Split APRIL 17, 2015 He’s the Last Boxer to Beat Floyd Mayweather Jr., and He So Regrets It APRIL 3, 2015 But its authority is limited. The W.B.C. is just one in an overstuffed alphabet soup of several competing bodies in boxing that each does virtually the same thing. For a fee, they sanction, or give their imprimatur to, different sets of matches in dizzying arrays of weight classes — ones you have heard of (middleweight) and ones you probably haven’t (super featherweight).\nPhoto Floyd Mayweather Sr., the boxer's father; Mayweather Jr.; Manny Pacquiao; and the trainer Freddie Roach with the W.B.C. belt. Credit Monica Almeida/The New York Times Mayweather and Pacquiao’s fight is in the welterweight class. That means they must weigh more than 140 pounds but no more than 147 pounds. They were to publicly step on a scale Friday to prove their welterweightness.\n“All I know is that they look pretty small, so they’re not heavyweight,” Mr. Behner said.\nMeanwhile, each of the four major sanctioning bodies has its own idiosyncratic ranking system. Each gives belts — they are called belts, though they are too big and heavy to thread through the loops on anyone’s pants or even to serve as superbelt-like cummerbunds — to each of its champions in each of the weight classes. These champions are not always the same people.\n“They all declare champions,” the boxing promoter Lou DiBella explained. “They all rank fighters, and their rankings can be totally different from each other’s. One champion will be fighting one day in one place, another will be fighting another day in another place.”\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Robert Bennett, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, also tried to explain.\n“What you have here is that currently Floyd Mayweather is the World Boxing Council champion, and he is also the World Boxing Association champion,” Mr. Bennett said. “Manny Pacquiao is the World Boxing Organization champion.”\nPhoto Kell Brook wearing the International Boxing federation welterweight belt. Credit Nick Potts/Press Association, via Associated Press Oh, dear. That means that those three groups are all sanctioning the Pacquiao-Mayweather fight, but the International Boxing Federation, the fourth group in the quartet, is not. This is because the I.B.F. already has its own welterweight champion, an English fellow by the name of Kell Brook, who is feeling pretty left out just now. (“I am the other world champion,” Mr. Brook told The Mirror newspaper recently.)\n“The fight is for the W.B.A. and the W.B.O. and the W.B.C. titles,” said Jeanette Salazar, a spokeswoman for the I.B.F. (Try to keep up here.) Speaking of Mayweather and Pacquiao, she said: “We don’t recognize them as the I.B.F. champions because they are not our champions.”\nContinue reading the main story Continue reading the main story The only way either of them could also become the I.B.F. champion, she explained, would be if they fought Mr. Brook and thus “unified” all the titles.\nEven though the fight here on Saturday is not connected to her group, she acknowledged its significance, calling Mr. Mayweather and Mr. Pacquiao “the top boxers today,” which also seemed confusing, given that the I.B.F. apparently thinks that the top boxer, at least in the welterweight category, is Mr. Brook.\nThis is all so annoying and complicated that HBO, for one, simply doesn’t discuss it on the air. HBO and Showtime are sharing the telecast Saturday night.\n“We decided many years ago that identifying or referring to boxing’s sanctioning bodies in our telecasts would not service our viewers,” said Rick Bernstein, executive producer of HBO Sports. “Fans identify with the fighters, and discussing sanctioning bodies and their policies is like going down a rabbit hole and not knowing when you’ll come out the other side.”\nPhoto Manny Pacquiao and Francisco Valcarcel, the president of the World Boxing Organization, with that group's title belt. Credit Monica Almeida/The New York Times That certainly seemed to be the case among the people in the food court in the enormous mall, casino and dining pavilion that passes for the lobby of the M.G.M. Grand hotel, where Saturday’s fight is to take place. None of them knew anything more than that there was going to be a fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao.\n“You have the W.B.A. and the W.B.O.,” began Kyle Warren, 28.\n“But I think this one’s the W.B.C.,” said his friend Mark Plumlee, 49. “Actually, I don’t have a clue what the different organizations are.”\nSince this is not HBO, we are allowed to address these issues and ask the big questions. Like, which of the sanctioning groups is boxing’s acknowledged organizing body?\nEr, none of them. Boxing does not have an acknowledged organizing body.\n“It’s botch city,” Mr. DiBella said. “This is a five-hour conversation. There’s no commissioner, there’s no regulator, there’s no ultimate authority.”\nPhoto Floyd Mayweather Jr., in cap, with the World Boxing Association title belt after a victory last May. Credit Isaac Brekken/Associated Press He continued: “Everyone’s better off with one champion and one body you can count on. But that is not how boxing works. This is how it is and how it’s been for generations.”\nSome boxing experts say that all the different belts and titles have little purpose except to make more money for boxers and promoters by generating more fights and spraying titles around like Champagne.\n“Belts are a dime a dozen, meaningless straps churned out by meaningless sanctioning bodies in order to collect a portion of each paper champion’s purse,” Connor Ruebusch wrote on the website SB Nation this week. “There are 111 of these belts spread out across 17 weight classes. It’s ridiculous.”\nMore relevant in this particular fight, people in boxing say, is that the competitors are objectively superior to everyone else — Mr. Mayweather with his unblemished record, Mr. Pacquiao with his many years of victories in different weight categories — and that a half-billion or so dollars is stake.\n“This title fight has zero to do with titles,” Mr. DiBella said. “It has to do with the two biggest names in boxing fighting this weekend.”\nStill, spectators should be prepared to see three belts — given by the W.B.O., the W.B.A. and the W.B.C. — handed to the winner of Saturday’s fight. Actually, make that four. According to Mr. Bennett, The Ring magazine, which has its own special boxing ranking system, might well also give out a title belt.\nWhy does it have to be so complicated? Asked why boxing couldn’t have just one sanctioning body, one set of rankings, one set of championship fights, and one belt at a time, Mauricio Sulaiman, lifetime president of the World Boxing Council, said that the system did not work that way.\n“The W.B.C. cannot control what others do,” he said in an email message. “Any day a new organization could be formed and we simply cannot do anything about it.”\nWhich all went right over the head of P.J. Williams, 34, an investment adviser from Ohio, who was struggling to beat his way through the thick forest of acronyms he had unwittingly waded into.\n“The W.B.O.,” he began, and then trailed off. “I don’t know. All I know is that this is a big deal.”",

      "text": "MARCH 13, 2015 The violence Thursday came just days after President Obama announced that he would visit Kenya in July, his first trip to his father’s homeland since taking office. Mr. Obama had stayed away until now, at least in part out of concerns about Kenya’s public safety. The White House issued a statement condemning the attack and vowing to continue assisting Kenya in fighting the Shabab — in recent months, the American military has killed the group’s leader and other operatives — but it offered no indication of whether the university siege would change Mr. Obama’s travel plans. The Kenyan authorities said that around dawn, the attackers stormed Garissa University College in the town of Garissa, about 90 miles from the Somali border. Though the college is in a predominantly ethnic Somali area of Kenya, it attracts students from across the country, many of them non-Muslim.

Credit Dai Kurokawa/European Pressphoto Agency In a statement early on Thursday, the Shabab said that its fighters had attacked the university early in the morning, separating Muslims from non-Muslims in an “operation against the infidels.” Continue reading the main story In an audio message soon after, a Shabab spokesman, Ali Mohamoud Raghe, said the attack had been carried out because “the Christian government of Kenya has invaded our country,” a reference to the Kenyan military’s 2011 incursion into Somalia to oust the Shabab from its strongholds. He said the university had been targeted because it was educating many Christian students in “a Muslim land under colony,” a reference to the large Somali population in a part of Kenya that Somalia once tried to claim. He called the university part of Kenya’s “plan to spread their Christianity and infidelity.” Photo Kenyan soldiers and ambulance workers responding to the attack by Somali militants at Garissa University College. Credit Dai Kurokawa/European Pressphoto Agency President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to crack down on terrorists, and on Thursday, he abruptly ordered 10,000 police recruits to report to duty despite a court order saying the recruits may have been selected through corrupt practices. Human rights observers have said that Mr. Kenyatta is trying to consolidate control and using the fear of terrorism to quash civil rights. On Thursday, panicked students streamed out of the besieged university with chilling stories of witnessing their classmates’ being killed. Augustine Alanga, 21, an economics student, said he had been asleep in his dormitory when the shooting began. He said he bolted from his room without stopping to put on his shoes, cutting his feet as he sprinted barefoot across the campus and into a nearby forest. “When I looked back, I saw them,” Mr. Alanga recalled. “There were five or six of them. They were masked. And they were shooting live rounds.” Continue reading the main story Shabab Attacks in Kenya Since 2012, more than 600 people have been killed in Kenya by the Shabab, an extremist group based in Somalia and affiliated with Al Qaeda. The group claimed responsibility for an April 2 attack on Garissa University College that killed 147 people. Mandera ",

      "text": "Crips and Bloods Come Together One major incident to report. Today, as the crowds rejoiced, a small huddle popped up in the middle of he intersection. Members of two rival gangs, the Crips and Bloods, help up and waved together the bandanas of their gang colors — blue and red, respectively — at an intersection near where the charges against the Baltimore police were announced. Everyone cheered, with many arguing that Freddie Gray’s death could continue unify their ranks, and perhaps create more peace across the city. “We came together for a common goal,” said a young man who identified himself only Goldie Loc, a Crip, 31. “This has been in the making.” “It’s a long way to go,” he added. “It’s not done. If it was any one of us we’d be locked up.” May 1, 2015 ACLU Responds Susan Goering, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, has issued a statement: This historic moment is the result of the tireless efforts of families who have lost loved ones to police violence — here in Baltimore, throughout Maryland, and all across America. They persistently have called attention to the double standards of our criminal justice system. We know that today’s announcement is only a first step in a state that has historically prosecuted less than two percent of police-involved deaths, while prosecuting thousands of African-Americans for petty offenses. Our systems of justice have been far more willing to treat officers as innocent until proven guilty than they are the communities who are being policed — communities where people are presumed guilty and stopped, searched, and arrested without cause. The ACLU of Maryland will continue to work for the structural reforms needed to end this double standard. May 1, 2015 ",

      "text": "See More » Artificial lakes filled with Sierra snowmelt will become baked-mud valleys, surrounded by ugly bathtub rings. Some rivers will dry completely — at least until a normal rain year. A few days ago, there was a bare trickle from the Napa, near the town of St. Helena, flowing through some of the most valuable vineyards on the planet. The state’s massive plumbing system, one of the biggest in the world, needs adequate snow in order to serve farmers in the Central Valley and techies in Silicon Valley. This year, California set a record low Sierra snowpack in April — 5 percent of normal — following the driest winter since records have been kept. Photo A redundant sign in a fallow field in Los Banos, Calif. Credit Ken Light/Contact Press Images, for The New York Times Continue reading the main story To Californians stunned by their bare mountains, there was no more absurd moment in public life recently than when James Inhofe, the Republican senator from Oklahoma who is chairman of the environment and public works committee, held up a snowball in February as evidence of America’s hydraulic bounty in the age of climate change. You can see the result of endless weeks of cloudless skies in New Melones Lake, here in Calaveras County in the foothills east of the Central Valley, where Mark Twain made a legend of a jumping frog. The state’s fourth largest reservoir, holding water for farmers, and for fish downstream, is barely 20 percent full. It could be completely drained by summer’s end. It’s a sad sight — a warming puddle, where the Stanislaus River once ran through it. At full capacity, with normal rainfall, New Melones should have enough water for nearly two million households for a year. Even worse is the Lake McClure reservoir, impounding the spectral remains of the Merced River as it flows out of Yosemite National Park. It’s at 10 percent of capacity. In a normal spring, the reservoir holds more than 600,000 acre-feet of water. As April came to a close, it was at 104,000 acre-feet — with almost no snowmelt on the way. (The measurement is one acre filled to a depth of a foot, or 325,851 gallons.) That’s the surface disruption in a state that may soon be unrecognizable in places. The morality tale behind California’s verdant prosperity will most certainly change. In the old narrative, the evil city took water from powerless farmers. Swimming pools in greater Los Angeles were filled with liquid that could have kept orchards alive in the Owens Valley, to the north. It was hubris, born in the words of the city’s chief water engineer, William Mulholland, when he opened the gates of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913 with an immortal proclamation: “There it is. Take it.” But now, just about everyone in California knows that it requires a gallon of water to grow a single almond, or that agriculture accounts for 80 percent of the water used by humans here. Meanwhile, the cities have become leaders in conservation. It takes 106 gallons of water to produce an ounce of beef — which is more than the average San Francisco Bay Area resident uses in a day. Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles wants to reduce the amount of water the city purchases by 50 percent in the next decade, cutting back through aggressive use of wastewater and conservation. It’s outlandish, urban critics note, for big farm units to be growing alfalfa — which consumes about 20 percent of the state’s irrigation water — or raising cattle, in a place with a third of the rainfall of other states. And by exporting that alfalfa and other thirsty crops overseas, the state is essentially shipping its precious water to China. Still, casting California farmers — who produce about half of the nation’s fruits, nuts and vegetables — as crony capitalist water gluttons may not be entirely fair. Yes, the water is subsidized, through taxpayer-funded dams, canals and pumping systems. But that water, in some cases, ends up as habitat for birds and wildlife. As it drains away, it can recharge badly depleted underground aquifers. Farmers have already let more than 400,000 acres go fallow and took a $2 billion hit last year. They may add 600,000 acres to that total this year. Almonds, after all, are a healthy food source. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The new morality tale becomes further muddled when you consider that San Francisco, praised for its penurious water ways, gets its life-supporting liquid from the Hetch Hetchy dam, in Yosemite. Many people, dating from the sainted John Muir, believe that flooding that mountain valley was one of the bigger crimes against nature in California history. And not every city is Spartan with its water. On any given day you can find, as I did in a new housing development in the foothills east of Sacramento, water running down the street — at a flow rate that looked bigger than that coming from the anemic Merced River. It was pouring onto a grass median strip, and then spilling over, in a development called the Estates at Blackstone. Or consider that wealthy communities — say, Portola Valley, woodsy home to many an environmentally conscious tech multimillionaire — use far more water per capita than do the poor of Compton, in the Los Angeles area. When cost is no object, there is very little incentive to cut back. But there is no getting around the fact that agriculture, for all its water needs, still produces barely 2 percent of the state’s gross product, and employs only about 3 percent of its workers. Photo Lawns are still watered, like this one in Los Angeles. Credit Annie Tritt for The New York Times Fair or not, it seems incongruous that farmers in the San Joaquin Valley are still planting new almond trees — they’ve nearly doubled the crop since 2005 — while people in the cities kill their lawns and dash in and out of low-flow showers. The idea that California could have it all — a pool in every suburban backyard, new crops in a drought, wild salmon in rivers now starved of oxygen — is fading fast. There is only so much more “pop per drop,” as Ms. Marcus, the State Water Resources Control Board chairwoman, said, or neighbor snitching on neighbor, until the urban majority resists and demands a change in allocation. What will come, then, from this disrupting drought is likely to be a shift of power. The urban “almond shaming” chorus is quick to note that the crop uses enough water to support 75 percent of the state’s population. In other words, there would be no water shortage in San Diego or Los Angeles if nut growers shut off the pumps. “Imagine if somebody ever said, ‘Let’s have a vote on how to use California’s water,’ ” said Daniel Beard, a former Bureau of Recreation commissioner and a critic of federal dam building. “That’s the last thing big agricultural interests would want.” The food industry is ripe for disruption. The land that has been left fallow now in the Central Valley is still less than 5 percent of all the irrigation acreage in California. Another 5 percent would leave most of the industry standing, and leaner. Low-value, high-water crops would disappear, as is already happening. Absent a vote of the people, the free market could end up as the decider. The big city water districts have more than enough money to buy farm water in a freewheeling exchange. Indeed, they’ve been making numerous purchases for years — though limited by complex water contracts and infrastructure that makes it difficult to pipe large amounts from one place to the other. Continue reading the main story In addition, one fear of making water an open-market commodity is that rich and politically powerful communities would get all the clean water they needed, while poor public districts would be left out. A class system around breathable air has already developed in China. Is abundant water the next must-have possession of the 1 percent? Agriculture will not give up its perch atop the power pyramid without a fight. Water that goes from the mountains to the sea is a waste, farmers say. The drought is “a man-made” disaster, as Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive who will likely run for the Republican presidential nomination, claims. She blames environmentalists for blocking major dam projects. “California is a classic case of liberals being willing to sacrifice other people’s lives and livelihoods at the altar of their ideology,” she said on Glenn Beck’s radio program a few weeks ago. Of course, one of those elites was Ronald Reagan, who as governor signed legislation in 1973 that protected the Eel River in Northern California from dam builders. “The environment is already taking a big hit in this drought,” said Ellen Hanak, director of the Water Policy Center at the nonprofit Public Policy Institute of California. “My sense is that Californians are pretty supportive of both a strong agricultural economy and a healthy environment.” Big new reservoir projects — a return of the concrete empire — are doubtful. Without a government subsidy, cost is the biggest obstacle. Farmers certainly aren’t going to pay the billions now footed by federal taxpayers. And then: Where is the “new” water going to come from? Underground, wells are probing ever deeper, sucking aquifers dry, the land sinking at a dramatic rate. Overhead, the sky is unreliable. Desalination, making seawater potable, is another option, which Carlsbad, north of San Diego, is now pursuing with a huge plant under construction. Australia went down this road during its epic drought in the 2000s. But the plants proved to be so prohibitively expensive to run that four of them were mothballed. Billions were spent without producing a drop of clean water. What California still has, in great supply, is ingenuity. Three years ago, Mitt Romney compared the state to bankrupt Greece. It was laughed at and written off by conservative pundits. California now has a budget surplus and led the nation in job growth last year — far outpacing Texas. The drought may indeed be a long overdue bill for creating an oasis civilization. But therein lies a solution. The Golden State is an invention, with lives to match. If the drought continues, California will be forced to rely even more on what has long sustained it — imagination. Not a bad thing to have too much of. Loading... ",

Photo The venture capital firm led by Marc Andreessen has a pro-talent stance that attracts tech founders but can make returns relatively modest. Credit Robert Galbraith/Reuters “A lot of what we’re trying to do at Andreessen Horowitz is based directly on Michael’s experience building C.A.A.,” Mr. Andreessen told the Silicon Valley big shots assembled for the occasion. The firm declined to comment for this article. Similarities between the two businesses run deep. It’s not just that the Andreessen Horowitz partners, including Mr. Andreessen’s longtime collaborator, Ben Horowitz, realized that a V.C. firm could be run like a talent agency. It’s that the economics of Silicon Valley are uncannily similar to those of Hollywood. And by exploiting that insight, they may have helped inflate a tech bubble. For all the attention Mr. Ovitz lavished on his stars — Creative Artists partners sat on boards of hospitals and private schools so they could help clients win preferential treatment — by far the most important things he procured for them were money and control. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In the mid-1970s, when Mr. Ovitz founded C.A.A., the breakdown of the traditional studio system had created a world in which stars had potentially enormous if little appreciated leverage. “For 60 years, the studios really took advantage of the creative talent,” Mr. Ovitz said in an interview. “We tried to change the entire curve.” The studios still craved stars but no longer had formal sway over them through long-term contracts. Mr. Ovitz assembled a murderers’ row of clients and used their collective power to win them fantastically lucrative business terms. “Ovitz said, ‘I’m going to straighten out your life,’ and he made a deal for me with Universal,” Martin Scorsese said in 1999 . “They built these offices and screening room and helped me with my film foundation.” The firm also represented Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise and Glenn Close. Continue reading the main story Mr. Andreessen, for his part, exploited a shift in power from venture capitalists to start-up founders in Silicon Valley. In the 1970s, V.C.s fronted entrepreneurs relatively small sums for large equity stakes in their start-ups. By the 2000s, however, new technologies trimmed the cost of getting a company off the ground. “We estimated that it costs 10 percent what it cost even 10 years ago to start a software company,” said David Golden of Revolution Ventures. Deep-pocketed individual investors known as angels also made it possible for nearly anyone to start a company without a V.C.’s help. By the time an entrepreneur met with one, the business was more likely to be growing exponentially, making the V.C. the supplicant. Venture capital used to be about ferreting out the best deals, said Naval Ravikant, a longtime investor who founded the investment syndication site AngelList. Now, he says, “the question is who gets access.” Andreessen Horowitz’s pro-talent stance has helped win over founders, but as with Creative Artists the key to its recruiting success has been the allure of highly favorable financial terms. The way the typical venture capital deal works is that the V.C. will place a “pre-money” valuation on the company he or she is hoping to fund, then add an equity stake on top of it. For example, if the V.C. deems the company to be worth $40 million before the investment, and invests $10 million, the V.C. will then own 20 percent of the company, now valued at $50 million. The higher the valuation, the better it is for the entrepreneur, who gives up less equity for a given amount of cash. Within Silicon Valley, Andreessen Horowitz is famous for bidding valuations to heights that make rivals uncomfortable. To offset the dilution of ownership that comes from such prices, Andreessen Horowitz — which says it manages $4.2 billion in assets — increases the amount of money it invests. The firm often kicks in more than the entrepreneur asks for, according to rival V.C.s who have been involved in these deals. (Some investors agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity.) “They want to basically change the table stakes in a poker game,” said Greg Kidd, an angel investor in several companies Andreessen later funded. “There are some other folks who can cut checks like that, but there aren’t that many.” Venture capitalists who have bid against Andreessen Horowitz say the firm often comes in 50 to 100 percent higher than many other bidders, as when it led an ill-advised $40 million investment round in a daily deal site called Fab in 2011, which valued the company at $200 million. (The firm has occasionally passed on big deals, like one with Uber, that it felt were too costly.) These prices are flattering to the entrepreneur, who suddenly runs a company worth twice as much on paper as previously thought. It is an article of faith in Hollywood that hiring stars significantly increases the chances of scoring a blockbuster. Alas, this is not the case. Studying movies released between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s, Arthur S. De Vany, an expert on film economics, found that the participation of only 19 star actors and directors appeared to improve a movie’s chances of grossing more than $50 million. And the stars’ stunning paydays often leeched away studio profits. Continue reading the main story The forces that govern movies and start-ups are remarkably similar. They both follow what is known as a power-law distribution, meaning that the overwhelming majority of investments lose money, while a small fraction break even or become marginally profitable, and an even smaller fraction become wildly successful. Mr. Andreessen and his partners seem to believe they’re playing a role analogous to that of Mr. Ovitz and his fellow superagents: They do what it takes to lock up talent, which they eventually sell to someone else at a huge markup. This generates profits for themselves and a nice payday for the stars, whether they are Hollywood celebrities or entrepreneurs. But what if the Andreessen Horowitz partners have the analogy wrong? Rather than profiting like Mr. Ovitz and his fellow agents, the venture capitalists may be more like the Hollywood studios — chronically overpaying for projects whose costs they can rarely recoup. Mr. Andreessen and his partners have invested so much in so many start-ups that it would take a remarkable string of successes to make the approach pay off. For all their skill — the firm bought into the likes of Airbnb, Instagram and Pinterest relatively early — their track record suggests it’s unlikely. Already, they’ve suffered a few impressive flameouts, including Fab, on which they are likely to lose tens of millions of dollars. Even when they pick well, they often bid so much for stars that the return is relatively modest. It’s easier to triple or quadruple your money when you’ve invested $10 million in a $100 million company than when you’ve invested nearly $100 million in a $1 billion company, as they did with the daily deal site Zulily. There are only so many companies that are acquired for billions of dollars or reach that kind of price through an initial public offering. Fewer retain such valuations — Zulily’s stock price has fallen sharply since last year. More than is the case with other firms, the fate of Andreessen Horowitz may be closely tied to that of the overall tech market. If prices remain buoyant, the eye-popping valuations of the firm’s top-performing companies will keep it profitable and losses will be containable. But if the market turns, Andreessen Horowitz could have serious trouble. Worse, Andreessen Horowitz isn’t just a beneficiary of behavior that’s driving up valuations. If a bubble is forming, it is ultimately because too much money is chasing too few companies. But the firm’s own aggressive bidding may be partly responsible. “Because there is competition for deals, when you have actors in the market showing no price discipline, it drives up the cost for everyone,” said one investor. Naturally, Mr. Andreessen has argued that the tech market is rational — that tectonic forces, like the proliferation of smartphones , have fundamentally changed the value of popular software. But even Mr. Andreessen has expressed some concern. Last September, he posted on Twitter : “When the market turns, and it will turn, we will find out who has been swimming without trunks on.” He warned that companies that hadn’t conserved their cash would “vaporize.” It may have been a plea to entrepreneurs on whom his firm had lavished tens of millions of dollars. Stars have many virtues. But the lesson taught by Hollywood is that they tend to make everyone poorer but themselves. \nThe Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

But since a powerful earthquake rocked Nepal a week ago, he has been afraid to climb the stairs to the rented rooms he shares with five family members.\nLike many of his neighbors in the usually thrumming Gongabu area of Katmandu, Mr. Suwal fears that the buildings still standing are so poorly constructed that they may be toppled by aftershocks.\n“A mountain is safer than this,” he said Wednesday of the four-story concrete and brick building where he lives. “Up there, climbing, I sometimes feel afraid, but not like this. This kind of danger is not in my hands.”\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage 3 Ways Nepalis Are Using Crowdsourcing to Aid in Quake Relief MAY 1, 2015 Nepal Survivors Lay Amid Rubble and Bodies After Earthquake APRIL 30, 2015 Across Nepal’s Countryside, Desperate Journeys to Ruined Homes After Quake APRIL 28, 2015 video Quake Survivor on Being Trapped for Days APRIL 30, 2015 Jittery fear has coursed through Nepal’s storied capital, Katmandu, since Saturday’s quake, which is thought to have killed more than 6,250 people across Nepal. Ancient temples in Katmandu crumpled from the intense pulses of seismic energy that the earthquake unleashed, but so did many dozens of buildings constructed after a modern building code was put in place.\nPhoto Houses on a hillside north of Katmandu, seen from an Indian Army helicopter, were destroyed in last week's earthquake. Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times That has ignited public alarm that the collapses exposed not only flaky concrete and brittle pillars, but also a system of government enforcement rotted by corruption and indifference.\nResidents and building experts say the corruption is an open secret, as evident as the unlicensed five- and six-story buildings that have risen in recent years, displacing two-story ones that sprang up in former farm fields starting a decade or so ago. The developers and landlords who slap up the buildings, the residents and experts say, know they will rarely be punished by officials, who are often happy to look the other way for a price.\n“We pay like this,” said Bir Bahadur Khadwada — the owner of the Kalika Guesthouse, frequented by migrant workers in Gongabu — as he rubbed his thumb with his index finger under his dining table. “They go away.”\nNepali experts said bribery, lax law enforcement and a lack of land-use controls left buildings vulnerable to seismic disasters. But several said those problems were symptoms of a deeper failing: the government’s inability to keep up with a rapidly urbanizing society.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Continue reading the main story Photographs of Earthquake Devastation in Nepal When Nepal was hit with a powerful earthquake the tremor shattered lives, landmarks and the very landscape of the country. The scope of the disaster in photographs.\nSince the nation’s building code was introduced in the 1990s, the population of greater Katmandu more than doubled. It grew to 1.74 million in 2011 , the year of the last census, from 675,000 in 1991 as migrants began pressing into the city, drawn by jobs and services that distant villages can only dream about: regular electricity, water and satellite television.\nIn recent decades, however, the Nepali government has undergone a convulsive succession of crises, including a bloody 10-year civil war with Maoist insurgents, that diverted government priorities and revenue from the task of managing urban growth.\nGeology further complicated matters: Katmandu is the ancient bed of a lake, and haphazard urban growth has allowed construction to spread to risky terrain, said Richard Sharpe, a New Zealand earthquake engineer who helped draft Nepal’s building code . “You shouldn’t just go and build anywhere,” he said. “You’ve got very soft soils in some places.”\nContinue reading the main story Despite many such warnings from scientists in recent years, modern housing, malls and shops, some built with breathless haste, filled in the contours of a city revered for its ancient monuments and temples.\nPhoto Nepali soldiers helped residents clear their belongings from damaged homes in Shankarapur on Friday. Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times “I think there’s still a hell of a lot of informal building,” Mr. Sharpe said in a telephone interview, referring to unlicensed and unplanned development. “And you’re in the Katmandu Valley, but what about the other 90 percent of the people, who are in the hills? How can you enforce the building code in the hills?”\nThe tally of the damage in those villages remains incomplete, with many isolated from rescuers by landslides and severed roads. In central Katmandu, at least 175 residential buildings were destroyed, according to satellite images compiled and assessed by the European Commission’s Copernicus Emergency Management Service . The Nepali authorities estimate that nationwide, nearly 150,000 dwellings collapsed. But larger, modern buildings, including urban hospitals and schools, mostly withstood the earthquake, reflecting more robust construction.\nNepal’s building code set what experts call admirable standards, but officials often enforced it in a perfunctory way, despite experts’ warnings that the country was in a region where a giant earthquake was a real risk, said Niyam Maharjan , a building engineer who works for the country’s Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development.\n“It’s too late,” he said this week, “but they are listening to us now.”\nContinue reading the main story Map Extent of the Damage From the Nepal Earthquake Maps show the landscape of temporary shelters, the epicenter of the earthquake and its aftershocks.\nOPEN Map The effects of Katmandu’s uncontrolled growth are distilled in Gongabu, where dozens of buildings collapsed and others slipped off their foundations and onto their sides.\nThe neighborhood has grown helter-skelter in recent years into an enclave for poorer workers, tourists and people abandoning the mountains for the city. Its identity is so caught up in Katmandu’s wild expansion that it is nicknamed New Bus Park, for the neighborhood’s long-distance bus terminal, where many migrants first arrive.\nThe area is a maze of four-, five- and six-story buildings — mainly shops, guesthouses that cater to poor Nepalis traveling to and from Katmandu for work and business, and small apartment buildings, often with small shops on their ground floors. Residents said bribery to allow illegal construction was common, and land-use planning unheard-of.\n“The buildings are taller and taller, but they want to save money on making them,” said Sumah Thapa, a stocky 30-year-old who makes a living selling tickets at the nearby bus station.\nPhoto The Boudhanath Stupa, center, one of the oldest Buddhist monuments in the Himalayas, four days after the earthquake. Credit Manish Swarup/Associated Press When the earthquake struck on Saturday, residents rushed onto the main street to escape the swaying buildings. But many did not make it. Officials would not say how many people in the area had died, though residents offered estimates ranging from dozens to hundreds.\n“Most of the buildings, I believe, they have not been built in compliance with the standard required,” said Yogeshwar Krishna Parajuli , the chief development commissioner of the Katmandu Valley Development Authority , which covers an area including the city of Katmandu. “They were constructed very superficially.”\nContinue reading the main story Continue reading the main story Residents ticked off the particular sins, saying regulations on building height and construction materials were regularly ignored, as were specifications for safety features like pillars.\n“Fourteen years ago, it was fields of vegetables, barley, potatoes,” said Jit Bahadur Limbu, a shop owner and longtime resident. “But now, even if our government doesn’t give permission, people make five- to seven-story buildings.”\nHe added, “The builder or your engineer pays the inspector to not make trouble and then gives you the bill.”\nHe and other residents estimated that bribes ranged from a few dollars to a few hundred, depending on the size of the project. Mr. Khadwada, the guesthouse owner, said that several years ago, through his building contractor, he had paid inspectors about $150 so they would turn a blind eye to two extra floors built on top of his guesthouse, in addition to the two permitted by construction codes.\nDays after the earthquake, many residents of New Bus Park remained in tents outside their homes and scoffed at the government’s suggestion that most houses in Katmandu were safe enough for them to move back indoors at night.\n“I’m still scared,” said Mr. Suwal, the trekking guide. “We will have to move back into our homes, but maybe the house is too weak for the next time. Can they tell us?”",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story For the second time in five years, Sergey Aleynikov was convicted on charges of stealing confidential computer trading code from his former employer, Goldman Sachs . The first time it took a federal jury just hours to convict; this time it came after more than a week of deliberation and an accusation of “food poisoning” and avocado tampering in a state court jury room. A jury on Friday convicted Mr. Aleynikov on one of the counts he faced but found him not guilty on another. They deadlocked on a third count against Mr. Aleynikov, who smiled nervously after the decision was announced. The split verdict — a striking conclusion to a case that divided the legal world, inspired a best-selling book and spotlighted the secret formulas behind high-frequency trading on Wall Street — came after the case nearly ended in what would have been the most bizarre of mistrials. The prospect of a mistrial stemmed from a dispute between two jurors deciding Mr. Aleynikov’s fate, with a female juror accusing a male one of “food tampering” — in part because an avocado was missing from her sandwich. The female juror also said she had taken a blood test to determine whether she was poisoned, turning the criminal proceedings into a culinary whodunit. Continue reading the main story Timeline: High Frequency Trading Trial But the judge overseeing the case, Justice Daniel P. Conviser of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, called her accusations “completely unfounded.” And after he dismissed the feuding jurors — and Mr. Aleynikov’s lawyer, Kevin Marino, dropped his request for a mistrial — both sides agreed to continue with a 10-member jury. Their verdict handed a partial victory to the Manhattan district attorney’s office in one of its most prominent financial cases in recent memory. With the conviction, prosecutors avoided what would have been an embarrassing defeat as it pursues an even bigger white-collar criminal trial: that of three former Dewey & LeBoeuf executives accused of concealing the law firm’s dire financial situation from investors. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The outcome of Mr. Aleynikov’s case raised questions about the decision by Mr. Marino and his client to roll the dice with the smaller jury. He could have objected to the remaining jurors, which would have either thrown the case into a mistrial or at least laid the groundwork for an appeal. According to people close to the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Mr. Marino and even some prosecutors suspected that the remaining jurors were prepared to acquit, which in hindsight was a miscalculation. In any other case, a conviction after near mistrial by food fight might seem something that only Hollywood could dream up. But in the on-again, off-again legal odyssey that is the People v. Aleynikov, it was merely the latest in a long line of peculiar twists. Mr. Aleynikov, a 45-year-old former Goldman software programmer who was born in Russia and is now a dual citizen in the United States, was first arrested on July 3, 2009. His conviction, which came at the hands of federal prosecutors in Manhattan, was overturned in 2012 by an appeals court, which ruled that the case had misapplied the corporate espionage laws against him. Continue reading the main story But the Manhattan district attorney’s office took up the case anew and eventually charged Mr. Aleynikov under state laws, drawing an outcry from defense lawyers who complained about prosecutorial overkill. Then, a state judge tossed out much of the prosecution’s evidence, ruling that the F.B.I. had conducted an “illegal” search and arrest of Mr. Aleynikov. Mr. Aleynikov, who lost his job and marriage in the fallout from the case, has become something of a cause célèbre in legal and media circles. Michael Lewis wrote a sympathetic profile of Mr. Aleynikov in Vanity Fair and later adapted the article into the best-selling book “Flash Boys” about high-frequency trading. For Mr. Aleynikov, who rejected a plea deal that would have spared him prison time, the verdict is a huge blow but not a dead end. A federal appeals court overturned his conviction once before, ruling that federal prosecutors had misapplied the corporate espionage laws against him, and a state appeals court could do the same. Justice Conviser has also signaled some skepticism about the case and left open the possibility that he might throw out a conviction, a rare step that takes place when a judge concludes that a verdict is legally invalid. The judge said he would take about five weeks to make his decision. Even if the conviction stands, Judge Conviser might exercise some leniency in sentencing. Mr. Aleynikov could face up to a few years in prison, though no minimum sentence is required. Mr. Marino is likely to emphasize that Mr. Aleynikov already served one year in federal prison in Fort Dix, N.J., before the appeals court vacated his conviction. The thrust of the case against Mr. Aleynikov, a bespectacled computer whiz who cuts a gaunt figure in the shadow of Mr. Marino’s football build, has not changed from federal to state court. Like federal prosecutors, the Manhattan district attorney’s office focused on Mr. Aleynikov’s decision to download proprietary Goldman source code before leaving the bank for a high-frequency trading firm in Chicago. He downloaded the code to a server in Germany and then to his own computer. To cover his tracks, Mr. Aleynikov tried to delete the history of commands on his Goldman computer. Mr. Marino did not challenge the underlying facts of the case. Instead, he said they added up not to a crime but to a simple breach of Goldman’s confidentiality policy. “There’s no doubt Mr. Aleynikov did something wrong,” he told the jury, stopping occasionally to sip from a water bottle he clutched to throughout the closing statement. “But this is a very badly misguided case.” A theatrical performer with a booming voice and a knack for hyperbole, Mr. Marino once shouted in open court that the case against Mr. Aleynikov was “a wild thing,” saying that prosecutors failed to establish the basic elements of the crimes they charged. He argued that Mr. Aleynikov did not profit from the code or deprive Goldman of economic gain, “essential elements” that the prosecution needed to prove. Continue reading the main story Mr. Marino, who called only two witnesses of his own, also emphasized that Mr. Aleynikov did not make a “tangible” reproduction of the files, a requirement for proving unlawful use of secret scientific material, which the jury ultimately convicted him on. The decades-old criminal statute had baffled jurors from the start of the deliberations, with the panel sending several notes to Justice Conviser seeking clarity on the meaning of the law, echoing a debate at trial over whether computer code was “tangible.” “Can you taste it?” Mr. Marino asked an F.B.I. agent who arrested Mr. Aleynikov. “I don’t think so,” the agent replied. Over the course of the trial, Mr. Marino benefited from some favorable judicial rulings. On what was supposed to be the first day of trial, Justice Conviser refused the prosecution’s request to delay the start for several weeks. Weeks later, the judge ruled that prosecutors could not call an expert witness because they failed to provide Mr. Marino adequate time to prepare. Daniel Holmes, a Manhattan assistant district attorney, made up some of that lost ground with a compelling closing argument. In the nearly 90-minute address — delivered to a courtroom packed with spectators — Mr. Holmes implored the jurors to use their “common sense.” “He may have regretted getting caught, but there’s no indication he regretted his actions,” Mr. Holmes said. Despite the long deliberations, signs of juror tension did not emerge until Tuesday. And even now, the exact nature of the avocado dispute is something of a mystery. Although the dispute was unforeseeable, Mr. Marino’s closing argument included a prophetic analogy to food. The prosecution failed to deliver the goods, he said, likening their case to promising to “bring 50 pizzas to a pool party and you show up with hamburgers.” On Monday, when the avocado dispute occurred, the jurors ordered lunch from Mon Cher market, which charges a dollar extra for avocado on sandwiches. Later on, jurors were on their own for lunch. But by Thursday, the court was back to ordering from Mon Cher.

      "text": "See All Updates As she ran for office last fall, Ms. Mosby vowed to be tougher on violent criminals and also more aggressive on police misconduct. People like Tawanda Jones, whose brother Tyrone West was killed after a violent scuffle with police, campaigned forcefully for her — in part, Ms. Jones said, to get rid of her predecessor, Gregg L. Bernstein. “I would have been a supporter of anybody to get him out of that chair,” Ms. Jones, who has been protesting police treatment of black men here since her brother died, said in an interview. “I was trying to get anybody that would take this seriously.” She said that after watching Ms. Mosby, she became convinced that she would. “I’m so happy, I’m so excited I can’t stop crying,” Ms. Jones said Friday, moments after Ms. Mosby’s announcement, which she saw on television while working at the preschool where she teaches. “She gave us her word. I said, ‘How will you handle police brutality?’ She said, ‘If you put me in this chair, I don’t care if they are in uniform or not. I come from a family of officers. Some are good, some are bad, I will hold everybody accountable to the law.’ And thank you, Jesus, she lived it out.” Aside from her family background in law enforcement, Ms. Mosby has other personal ties to justice issues. When she was growing up in Boston, a 17-year-old cousin was mistaken for a drug dealer and killed outside her home by another 17-year-old. She has been outspoken about the need to hold police officers accountable.",

      "text": "A Dozen Whitney Works to Be Displayed in Lights on the Empire State Building APRIL 26, 2015 Inside Photo The Empire State Building was illuminated Friday during a test run of Marc Brickman's representations of paintings from the Whitney Museum of American Art. Credit Kevin Hagen for The New York Times Continue reading the main story “King Kong” was so 20th century. All that climbing and heavy breathing — so low-tech. This is the 21st century. Marc Brickman can have his way with the Empire State Building from wherever he happens to be, which, on Friday, will probably be his usual hangout, somewhere in a hotel with an unobstructed view. Mr. Brickman, a lighting designer, has worked with Pink Floyd, Bruce Springsteen and the Blue Man Group, and has created light shows for the Summer Olympics in 1992 and the Winter Olympics in 1998. On Friday, to take note of the Whitney Museum of American Art ’s move downtown, he will conjure representations of a dozen works of art onto the sides of the Empire State Building . More about the idea behind those representations later. The paintings are not Mr. Brickman’s, although he does paint as a hobby, he said. The paintings are from the Whitney collection. “We’re dealing with Andy Warhol and Elizabeth Murray and Rothko ,” he said. “Giants.” Of course, the Empire State Building is a giant in its own right, and Mr. Brickman’s representations will be displayed with its almost infinitely morphable light system, on the giant space starting at the 72nd floor and climbing 31 stories, as well as 200-plus feet on the antenna structure that gives the building its full 1,454-foot height. “It’s like the biggest gallery in the world,” said Donna De Salvo , the chief curator and deputy director for programs at the Whitney Museum . Photo \"Flowers\" by Andy Warhol is one of the paintings that will be reimagined on the Empire State Building on Friday. Credit 2015 Andy Warhol Foundation/Artists Rights Society (ARS) New York For the record, the paintings in question are measured in mere inches. Warhol’s “Flowers” is 36 inches by 36 inches, to name one that Mr. Brickman considers a personal favorite. Murray’s “ Children Meeting ” is larger, at 101 3/16 inches by 127 inches. Mark Rothko’s “ Untitled (Blue, Yellow, Green on Red) ” is in-between, at 77 3/4 inches by 65 1/2 inches. Jasper Johns ’s “ Three Flags ” is 30 5/8 inches by 45 1/2 inches, and 4 5/8 inches deep. Translating — or transforming — paintings like this is a first for the Empire State Building. It lights up in color nearly every night, recognizing everything from sports teams to charities to college commencements. Ms. De Salvo said the light show for the Whitney’s move “could have been the simplest of the red, white and blue.” That would have recognized the “American” in the Whitney’s full name, she said, stretching out the word “American” for emphasis. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But the planners at the Empire State Building “really got into it,” Ms. De Salvo said. “They started to think about works in our collection.” They could consider such possibilities because in 2012 the Empire State Building installed an LED lighting system that could generate 16 million colors. It was a far cry from the outdoor lights — four beacons — that were installed by 1956, 25 years after the building opened. They were replaced by more powerful floodlights in 1964, just in time for the World’s Fair, and by colored lights in 1976, just in time for the nation’s bicentennial. For years, the colors were changed by maintenance workers who put colored plastic lenses on more than 200 bulbs. Photo Mr. Brickman, a lighting designer, has worked with Pink Floyd and Bruce Springsteen. Credit Emily Berl for The New York Times Continue reading the main story The new system can be programmed to change colors by itself, no plastic lenses necessary. But conveying paintings on that scale? A painting is paint on canvas. This is light on limestone. “This is not meant to be a reproduction; it’s meant to be representational,” said Anthony E. Malkin, the chairman and chief executive of Empire State Realty Trust, which owns and operates the building. “This is performance art.” “It’s using the color palette” of the paintings, Mr. Malkin said. “It’s trying to convey the sense of what the artists presented.” “Personally, I collect Wyeths ,” he said, “but I know a Rothko from a mile away. You know a Jasper Johns. We’re not trying to go with subtlety here. We’re trying to go with visually recognizable themes of major works. I’ve heard Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 23 a million times, and if you were a real aficionado and you owned a lot of recordings, you would have heard it dozens and dozens of times and you would recognize the subtleties of each performance. If you’re that guy, you’ll connect to this in a different way than someone who clicks on Google for Jasper Johns. Somebody who’s a collector is going to appreciate it differently from someone who is not, but we’re making it possible for somebody who’s not to appreciate it as well.” Photo “Children Meeting” by Elizabeth Murray. Credit 2015 The Murray-Holman Family Trust/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York The Whitney sent Mr. Brickman high-resolution images of some of the paintings, and there was a test of what he had in mind. A “virtual representation,” Ms. De Salvo called it — images on a computer screen, not on the building itself. “It didn’t happen in the middle of the night and you missed it,” she said. But there was a run-through in the middle of the night last Friday. Photographers who documented it captured an extravaganza that was more of a light show than a gallery show. “It was taking what I do and putting it in the context of the art world rather than doing a Pink Floyd show or the Olympics or just another lighting of the Empire State Building,” Mr. Brickman said. “I thought this was an opportunity to take the greatest artists in the world and use that as inspiration, their color palettes and the way they painted — for instance, Rothko and how he used color — and really try to emulate that on the building.” And as for whether everything will happen on cue this Friday, he said there were backup systems and “redundancy everywhere.” He mentioned the night Hurricane Sandy roared through in 2012: “The lights stayed on while a good portion of New York went black that night. The redundancy was so good, the lights stayed on like a beacon.” The light show will coincide with the Empire State Building’s 84th anniversary, and there is more of a Whitney tie-in than just this event with the lights. The Whitney’s collection includes a Lewis Hine photograph of one of the ironworkers who pushed the building’s steel frame into the clouds. “ Sky boys ,” Hine called them. On Friday, Mr. Brickman’s plan is to walk out of the control room inside the Empire State Building before the lights go on. He will head for his hotel, leaving Dietrich Juengling, a special effects artist, to run the computers that control the light show. Mr. Brickman will be in touch by cellphone, which, for all the technology involved, will echo the building’s very first day , in 1931. President Herbert Hoover turned on the lights inside — but he was not on the premises, either. He, too, did the honors by remote control, from Washington.

      "text": " It started with Instagram. Or maybe it ended with Instagram. Last fall, Christina Turner, a fashion stylist in Brooklyn, was dreading another New York winter in her cramped, lightless Greenpoint, Brooklyn, apartment while gazing longingly at the succulent gardens and festive backyard dinner parties posted on social media by her friends in Los Angeles.\n“I’d see all these old familiar faces of friends I once knew in New York, all seated at the same table,” said Ms. Turner, 32, who goes by the professional name Turner.\nShe could resent them, or she could join them. So in November, Ms. Turner dumped her furniture on Craigslist, piled into her battered Honda Accord and headed west, not stopping until she found a light-filled two-bedroom cottage in Echo Park, a neighborhood in eastern Los Angeles that is a magnet for young creatives.\nThe wagon train mentality, it seems, is taking hold among the L train set: Go west!\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Scene Stealers: A Place in Los Angeles for Vegans and Their Non-Vegan Friends APRIL 24, 2015 Road Warrior: Riding a Van Back to the ’70s MAY 1, 2015 In an era when it has become fashionable for New Yorkers to grumble that their own city is becoming a sterile playland for the global-money set (Dubai with blizzards, basically), Los Angeles is enjoying a renaissance with a burgeoning art, fashion and food scene that has become irresistible to the culturally attuned.\nPhoto Hamish Robertson, an artist, with his wife, the writer Andi Teran, at their home in Los Feliz. Credit John Francis Peters for The New York Times As a result, the old New York-Los Angeles rivalry is changing, at least on the East Coast side of the equation. No longer do in-the-know New Yorkers reflexively parrot sneers like the old Woody Allen line, that the only cultural advantage of Los Angeles is the right turn on red.\nIn some quarters, the scorn that New Yorkers once piled on Los Angeles is now sounding like envy.\nIndeed, Los Angeles has seemingly become the flight fantasy of choice for the likes of Ms. Turner, who insists that anything good she was giving up in overpriced, overstressed Brooklyn is already in place on the booming east side of Los Angeles: the in-season Zambian coffee outposts, the galleries, the vintage clothing boutiques.\nWith that area’s scruffy bohemian spirit and laid-back mood, she thinks she had found the best of her New York life without the migraines. “It’s like grown-up version of Williamsburg,” Ms. Turner said, “without the gray cloud.”\nTo anyone old enough to have seen “Annie Hall” on the big screen, such a notion sounds like apostasy. For generations, Los Angeles served as a punch line to any self-respecting New Yorker. “Just a big parking lot,” as John Lennon reportedly said; a “triumph of the garish,” as Paul Rudnick wrote. Andy Warhol claimed to embrace the city, but only because “everybody’s plastic.” “I love plastic,” he added.\nContinue reading the main story In 2000, the “ Sex and the City ” characters ran off to Los Angeles for a two-episode romp in the sun, but ran screaming from the vapid wasteland of bottle blondes, D-cup implants and overzealous Brazilian treatments. (“The next day four New Yorkers left L.A. a little lighter,” Carrie concluded. “Some of us had lost our hair and all of us had lost a little dignity.”)\nBut reflexive New York snobbery has gone out of vogue, even among influencers for whom New York is an identity.\nMoby, the techno pioneer who was born on West 148th Street and molded by the East Village, confessed in the The Guardian last year that he had not only moved to Los Angeles, but become such a “clichéd Angeleno” that he taunts New York friends with photos of himself by the pool in February.\n“I was so accustomed to the city’s absurd cult of money that it took me years to notice I didn’t have any artist friends left in Manhattan,” he wrote. Los Angeles, by comparison, is now where young artists “can really experiment, and if their efforts fall short, it’s not that bad because their rent is relatively cheap and almost everyone else they know is trying new things and failing, too.”\nLena Dunham once told Vogue that she could spend only two weeks in Los Angeles before starting “to get a very sad feeling,” but recently paid a reported $2.7 million for George Peppard’s former Hollywood home.\nNo less a New York mascot than Fran Lebowitz, whose jaded, cigarette-sucking visage may as well be inscribed on the city seal, also confessed to a change of heart about Los Angeles.\n“L.A. is better than it used to be, New York is worse than it used to be,” Ms. Lebowitz said at a recent Vanity Fair party for the Tribeca Film Festival . The quality-of-life campaigns under Mayors Giuliani and Bloomberg swept away so much that was gritty, quirky or exceptional about the city, she said, and as a result, “New York has become vastly more suburban,” while “L.A. has become slightly less suburban.”\nThis is not a trivial point. Los Angeles is widely acknowledged to have become strikingly more cosmopolitan in recent years.\nThe art scene, for one, has exploded. More than 50 galleries have sprouted since late 2013, reported the alternative newspaper LAWeekly, which noted that the scene is starting to fan out from Downtown and central Hollywood to new terrain like West Adams, Leimert Park and Culver City.\nAnn Philbin, a former New Yorker who is the director of the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, said that while New York remains the commercial hub for the art market, emerging artists and recent art school graduates are increasingly migrating west.\nContinue reading the main story “Many people say that there are more creative people — visual artists, musicians, writers, filmmakers — living in Los Angeles than there are in any other city in the world, and I feel it,” Ms. Philbin said. “It’s like New York in the ’80s. There is a huge, growing community of artists here.”\nA similar renaissance is underway in fashion. Hedi Slimane, the creative director of Saint Laurent, moved the fashion house’s studio to Los Angeles, while labels like Band of Outsiders and Rodarte spearhead a homegrown design scene.\nThe fashion A-list is turning its sights west, thanks to spectacles like Burberry’s recent runway show at the Griffith Observatory, which drew 700 guests, including Anna Wintour and Elton John.\n“Los Angeles was once just a city of jeans, but it is quickly becoming a high-fashion town,” said Joe Zee, the editor in chief of Yahoo Style, who now splits his time between the cities. “There was such a snobbery about L.A. with New Yorkers before, but that tide has really changed.”\nFar from the red carpets and glitz, entire neighborhoods, many clustered on the city’s east side, are undergoing a much-documented haute-boho revival.\nPhoto The musician Julia Price, a former Manhattanite, in Santa Monica, Calif. Credit John Francis Peters for The New York Times Bearded young New Yorkers can snap up brioche tarts at Proof Bakery in Atwater Village, visit gallery shows at Shepard Fairey’s Subliminal Projects in Echo Park, or settle in over barrel-aged rye cocktails at Bar Stella in Silver Lake, and scarcely realize they are more than a stroll away from McCarren Park, except for the 70-degree sunshine tickling their cheeks in February.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The changes are more striking in downtown Los Angeles. Long a gritty urban backwater, Downtown has become a trend factory, brimming with Beaux-Arts loft condos, galleries, groundbreaking restaurants like Baco Mercat and, inevitably, a new Ace Hotel to serve as “Portlandia” south. ( GQ magazine called Downtown Los Angeles “America’s next great city” last year.)\nThe buzz from all this is audible 3,000 miles east, to the point that New Yorkers’ incessant Williamsburg comparisons to Silver Lake, Highland Park, Venice Beach — or wherever — have become a wearying cliché to locals (except Aja Brown, the mayor of Compton, Calif., who has been pitching her economically challenged south-central city as “ a new Brooklyn ” of late.)\nNo wonder a new generation of restless New Yorkers is starting to heed the Los Angeles siren call, and not just aspiring actor-waiters, as in years past.\n“New York feels like it’s all about ‘making it,’ ” said Julia Price , a musician and former Manhattanite who is in her 20s. “L.A. feels like it’s all about making things.”\nContinue reading the main story In New York, she said, she was so busy working to pay the bills that she often toiled from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. as a production assistant for “Good Morning America,” then from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. as a cocktail waitress. Los Angeles, with its slower pace and cluster of young artists, has proved to be fertile ground for her artistic ambitions.\n“I couldn’t believe how collaborative everyone out here was,” Ms. Price said. “Want to shoot a music video? Just put up a Facebook message and within hours you’ll have 15 responses from incredibly talented, passionate people who want to work for free, because they believe in you and your art.”\nThis view of Los Angeles as a familial, welcoming city — as Moby put it, a great place to fail — is comically at odds with the traditional view. This is a town that has been grinding them up and spitting them out since Peg Entwistle , the star-crossed actress, leapt to her death off the “H” in the Hollywood (back then, “Hollywoodland”) sign in 1932, after all.\nBut to many New York expatriates, the relatively lower cost of living alone can justify a move. As much as Angelenos (justifiably) howl about spiking real estate prices, New Yorkers still see bargains.\nFor $600 less than the $1,850 a month Ms. Turner was paying for her grim junior one-bedroom in Greenpoint, she found a charming two-bedroom 1920s bungalow in Echo Park with a gated yard, cactuses, a barbecue, a separate work studio and a garage.\nThis is not to say Los Angeles is always a natural fit. The New Yorker is always going to be a nonnative species in Los Angeles, which has its own status codes, its own rhythms, its own body language.\n“There’s a major adjustment period,” said Jeff Thrope, a creative consultant (and former contributor to T Magazine) who moved from New York. “Los Angeles is definitely not New York with palm trees.” “\nNewcomers face a catastrophic drought (a developing crisis), and endless traffic snarls (an enduring one). The latter may explain why the emerging image of Los Angeles as bohemian paradise seems to take hold mostly among those whose careers allow them to work at home in blogging, photography and freelance web design.\n“On the east side, where we live, we know maybe four or five people who work traditional 9-to-5 office jobs, out of our entire friend circle,” said Hamish Robertson, an artist and designer who lives in Los Feliz with his wife, Andi Teran, a novelist. “And if they do have them, it hasn’t come up, because people rarely ask what you do for a living or where you went to school.”\nContinue reading the main story Continue reading the main story At this point, it’s impossible to say how many New Yorkers are actually taking the plunge. The census bureau does not specifically track the migration patterns of Bushwick neo-expressionists and digital brand strategists.\nWhat you are left with are quasi-statistics like this: Jessa Blades, a makeup artist and beauty and wellness entrepreneur from Fort Greene, Brooklyn, decided to split her time between the cities, in part because a dozen friends had already made the move in the last 18 months, “which makes it easier to find a community,” she said.\nWhat is measurable is that the invading New Yorker is becoming a familiar enough archetype to inspire a backlash of sorts.\nThe popular site LAist circulated a handy map, originally created by the online magazine The Morning News, highlighting the most New Yorker-friendly neighborhoods, but adding a series of anti-New Yorker swipes. “If you happen to be from NY, and are feeling ill at ease in the vapid wasteland of Los Angeles, you can either” — well, leave, the post saltily suggested — “or figure out where you’re more likely to feel like you’re at home in NY.”\nThe LAWeekly ran a list of “The Six Types of Transplants Ruining L.A.,” topped by, of course, New Yorkers.\n“The only thing New Yorkers love more than talking about New York is talking about how Los Angeles isn’t New York,” the article said, detailing a familiar list of complaints (limited public transit, people too polite, bars close too early).\nAt least New Yorkers were No. 1 again.",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story MEXICO CITY — A Mexican military helicopter was shot down Friday in southwest Mexico , killing three soldiers and wounding several others during an outbreak of violence in the region that left banks and gas stations ablaze and residents hunkering indoors, military and regional officials said. An armed group in a rural area of Jalisco State fired on the helicopter, forcing it to make an emergency landing. The army said in a statement that three soldiers died and 12 others aboard were wounded, but it was not clear if their injuries were from gunfire or the landing. It was a rare fatal attack on a military aircraft, though several have been strafed or forced to land because of mechanical mishaps as Mexico has stepped up their use in recent years to battle organized crime groups. Jalisco erupted in violence early Friday, with 11 banks and 16 gasoline stations set on fire and nearly 30 road blockades formed by flaming vehicles, many of them in the Guadalajara metropolitan area, the country’s second-largest. A total of seven people, including the soldiers, were reported killed, and 15 people were arrested, while the governor of the state, Aristóteles Sandoval, declared a “red alert” and appealed for calm. “The whole government is active,” he said in a post on Twitter. “Security in the state is being redoubled.” The American Consulate in Guadalajara issued a warning to its employees to stay in their homes; Friday was a holiday in Mexico, Labor Day, when many people normally flock to vacation spots. One of them, Puerto Vallarta, on the Pacific Coast in Jalisco, reported fires as well, though they did not appear to be near resorts. The state and federal governments had announced an operation aimed at rooting out the leaders of powerful drug gangs, in particular the Jalisco New Generation, which has been blamed for a series of attacks and ambushes on the police and military as it gains supremacy in a region long a battle zone for gangs. Five members of the federal police’s elite Gendarmerie unit were killed in an ambush in March, its first losses since it was formed last year with much fanfare, and last month 15 state police officers were attacked and killed, one of the highest tolls on security forces in the past few years. The wave of violence follows other outbreaks in recent months, including gun battles last month in Tamaulipas State, along the border with Texas, and the abduction last fall of 43 college students, who the authorities say were later killed and burned to ashes by a drug gang working in league with local police officers. A report by the Justice in Mexico project at the University of San Diego said that homicides had declined in Mexico in the past three years, including an estimated 9 percent to 15 percent in 2014, though it noted that reliable figures were difficult to come by because of discrepancies among the census bureau and security agencies on how murders are tallied. “Even amid the overall reduction in violence, there were serious security crises in central and Pacific states,” the report said, adding that Jalisco is among the states that “have emerged as new trouble spots in Mexico’s battle against organized crime.” Loading...

      "text": "Continue reading the main story RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil ’s political establishment was shaken on Friday by the news that federal prosecutors had opened an influence-peddling inquiry into the business activities of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , the former president who presided over Brazil’s emergence this century as a leading power in the developing world. The report comes at a difficult time for the governing Workers Party, with Mr. da Silva’s protégé and successor, Dilma Rousseff, struggling with calls for her impeachment over a bribery scandal at the national oil company. Mr. da Silva, 69, was among the founders of the party in 1980. The inquiry by a special anticorruption unit of the Public Ministry, a body of independent prosecutors, is reportedly delving into Mr. da Silva’s ties to Odebrecht, one of Brazil’s largest construction companies. That the inquiry, a preliminary step before deciding whether to open a broader investigation, had opened in recent days was first reported by the Brazilian magazine Época. The prosecutors are examining whether Mr. da Silva improperly used his influence as a former president and one of Brazil’s most powerful political figures to obtain loans from Brazil’s national development bank, a state-controlled financial institution with a lending portfolio larger than that of the World Bank, for Odebrecht’s dealings in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. After eight years as president, from 2003 to 2010, when Brazil enjoyed robust economic growth and expanded its antipoverty projects, Mr. da Silva leveraged his prominence to attract lucrative speaking engagements outside Brazil. He often traveled abroad on one of Odebrecht’s private jets, Época reported, and is also facing scrutiny over the company’s activities in Angola, Ghana and Venezuela. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Odebrecht denied any wrongdoing in connection to the questions raised in the inquiry. Paulo Okamotto, the president of Mr. da Silva’s institute, also said that there was nothing improper about Mr. da Silva’s speeches. Speaking before supporters in São Paulo on Friday during a commemoration of International Workers’ Day, Mr. da Silva did not specifically address news of the inquiry. But in a speech , he lashed out at some in the news media, referring specifically to Época and Veja, another magazine that has reported critically on him. “I see in these Brazilian magazines, which are trash, the insinuations,” Mr. da Silva said. “They’re out to get Lula, but that’s what I like if they want a fight.” Loading...

Today, his father said, that dream seemed out of reach. “Myself and my family really believe he’ll be exonerated, but in the meantime, he’ll have to go through hell to do so,” he said. “It’ll probably destroy his life, his career and his motivation to help other people.” Continue reading the main story Michael Davey, a lawyer whose firm is representing Lieutenant Rice and who said he was speaking on behalf of all six officers, said that none of them had done anything wrong. He described Lieutenant Rice as a man who has “dedicated his life to serving the public.” After announcing the charges on the steps of Baltimore’s neoclassical War Memorial building, Ms. Mosby stressed that the charges should not be viewed as a criticism of the entire department. She noted that both her mother and father had been police officers. “To the rank-and-file officers of the Baltimore Police Department, please know that these accusations of these six officers are not an indictment on the entire force,” she said. But an official in Baltimore’s Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 expressed outrage over the charges, saying that Ms. Mosby has a striking conflict of interest. \"The union believes it is political,\" the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the case. \"It is a witch hunt.\" Referring to the protests of the past week, some of which turned violent, the official further stated: \"They are trying to buy peace here.” The union official said it was \"very problematic\" that William Murphy Jr., the lawyer representing the Gray family, has a direct political link to Ms. Mosby. Mr. Murphy served on Ms. Mosby’s transition team for her current job and donated several thousand dollars to her campaign for state attorney in Baltimore. The union official also pointed out that Ms. Mosby’s husband, Nick Mosby, is a member of the Baltimore City Council who sits on the Public Safety Committee. The official said that the union views the City Council and the mayor as not supportive enough of the police and that they have supported reforms to police and fire pension systems that union officials oppose. To Ms. Neal, matters of municipal politics and criminal law did not take precedence over her desire to support Sergeant White’s family. Despite the anger that has spread over the death of Mr. Gray, and the relief that many here expressed at the arrest of the officers, Ms. Neal said she would stay committed to her friend. “I had prayers with her mom over the case,” she said. \nAlan Blinder contributed reporting.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil ’s political establishment was shaken on Friday by the news that federal prosecutors had opened an influence-peddling inquiry into the business activities of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , the former president who presided over Brazil’s emergence this century as a leading power in the developing world. The report comes at a difficult time for the governing Workers Party, with Mr. da Silva’s protégé and successor, Dilma Rousseff, struggling with calls for her impeachment over a bribery scandal at the national oil company. Mr. da Silva, 69, was among the founders of the party in 1980. The inquiry by a special anticorruption unit of the Public Ministry, a body of independent prosecutors, is reportedly delving into Mr. da Silva’s ties to Odebrecht, one of Brazil’s largest construction companies. That the inquiry, a preliminary step before deciding whether to open a broader investigation, had opened in recent days was first reported by the Brazilian magazine Época. The prosecutors are examining whether Mr. da Silva improperly used his influence as a former president and one of Brazil’s most powerful political figures to obtain loans from Brazil’s national development bank, a state-controlled financial institution with a lending portfolio larger than that of the World Bank, for Odebrecht’s dealings in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. After eight years as president, from 2003 to 2010, when Brazil enjoyed robust economic growth and expanded its antipoverty projects, Mr. da Silva leveraged his prominence to attract lucrative speaking engagements outside Brazil. He often traveled abroad on one of Odebrecht’s private jets, Época reported, and is also facing scrutiny over the company’s activities in Angola, Ghana and Venezuela. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Odebrecht denied any wrongdoing in connection to the questions raised in the inquiry. Paulo Okamotto, the president of Mr. da Silva’s institute, also said that there was nothing improper about Mr. da Silva’s speeches. Speaking before supporters in São Paulo on Friday during a commemoration of International Workers’ Day, Mr. da Silva did not specifically address news of the inquiry. But in a speech , he lashed out at some in the news media, referring specifically to Época and Veja, another magazine that has reported critically on him. “I see in these Brazilian magazines, which are trash, the insinuations,” Mr. da Silva said. “They’re out to get Lula, but that’s what I like if they want a fight.” Loading...",

      "text": "Alex Rodriguez of Yankees Ties Willie Mays With 660th Home Run By BILLY WITZ Inside Photo Alex Rodriguez before Friday's game in Boston. Rodriguez hit his 660th home run to tie Willie Mays's mark. Credit Elise Amendola/Associated Press Continue reading the main story Alex Rodriguez, the Yankees’ lightning rod slugger, hit his 660th home run at Fenway Park on Friday night, tying him with Willie Mays for fourth on baseball’s career home run list. Rodriguez, appearing as a pinch-hitter, belted a pitch from Junichi Tazawa in the eighth inning over the left-field wall of Fenway’s fabled Green Monster. The solo blast put the Yankees ahead, 3-2. It was the sixth home run of the season for Rodriguez, who, despite nearing his 40th birthday and returning from a yearlong suspension for using performance-enhancing drugs, has been a surprisingly significant player for the Yankees as their regular designated hitter. The home run provided another turn in the limelight for a player who has craved it — and has had no problem finding it, thanks to his bat and his impolitic behavior. This milestone is a melding of both. APRIL 22, 2015 It has created an awkward moment for the Yankees, who have told Rodriguez they will not honor the marketing agreement that calls for him to receive a series of $6 million bonuses for tying Mays (660), Babe Ruth (714) and Henry Aaron (755), and for tying and passing the career leader, Barry Bonds (762). The Yankees say that the agreement, reached in 2007, is void because Rodriguez’s use of performance-enhancing drugs will keep them from being able to recoup the bonuses through the sale of merchandise connected to the events. Two years after the agreement, Rodriguez admitted using steroids, and six years later he was suspended for his role in the Biogenesis scandal. The bonus issue almost seemed a moot point back in 2013, when Rodriguez, after a long rehabilitation for hip surgery, returned to play the final leg of the season even as he was being hit with a mammoth drug suspension by Major League Baseball. He appeared diminished on the field and, as he appealed his suspension, lashed out at the Yankees, his own players’ union and baseball officials. Rodriguez lost his appeal and sat out the 2014 season. And the relationship between Yankees management and Rodriguez turned so bitter that as spring training approached this year, there were questions whether the team would cut him despite owing him $61 million over the final three seasons of his contract, or if it would pressure Rodriguez to take an injury retirement, which would have allowed him to collect the remainder of his contract and for the Yankees to recoup the loss through insurance. Though the team has made mention of other recent milestones, such as second baseman Stephen Drew’s 100th career home run or Rodriguez’s passing Derek Jeter on the career runs scored list, it did not, until recently, mention Rodriguez’s pursuit of Mays in its daily notes to the news media. Rodriguez is also closing in on 3,000 hits — he now has — but because there is no disputed bonus tied to that achievement, the Yankees will presumably have no problem publicizing that pursuit as it heats up. For his part, Rodriguez has been well behaved in his return. The only time he has miffed the Yankees was when he showed up two days early to spring training without notifying them. He has consistently taken a humble public stance, saying he is simply happy to be playing a game he loves and that he was not sure what to expect this season. He has not expressed any displeasure about losing his third-base job to Chase Headley. General Manager Brian Cashman, who has feuded with Rodriguez in the past, struck a conciliatory tone early in spring training, saying Rodriguez’s spot on the roster was assured. And he, like Manager Joe Girardi, tempered everyone’s expectations. Even after a strong spring training, Rodriguez began the season batting seventh. He has now moved into a more customary spot, third. “I wasn’t sure what to expect in spring training,” Girardi said last week. “But Alex is a worker and he knows how to play the game. And he’s been a really smart player for a long period of time, so if there’s anyone who can figure it out quickly, it would be Alex.” Rodriguez’s performance has moved him into the good graces of many, but not all, Yankees fans. On the road, Rodriguez has been booed, though it often seems as if it is a matter of course. As Rodriguez noted recently, he has been a popular villain since 2001, when he signed a then-record $252 million free-agent contract with the Texas Rangers. “I’m going to have some good days, some bad days and some ugly days,” Rodriguez said recently. “What I want to do all year is just enjoy the game as much as I can.” Loading...

Their goal was to secure endorsements from a broad spectrum of officials, including Democrats such as Mayor Sokolich.\nThis cultivating fell mostly to young staff members in the wing of Mr. Christie’s front office known as Intergovernmental Affairs. In August 2013, Ms. Kelly, the deputy chief of staff in that office, expressed disappointment to Mr. Wildstein that Mr. Sokolich, who had been the subject of intense wooing by her office and the authority, was not going to endorse Mr. Christie.\nMs. Kelly, like Mr. Baroni and Mr. Wildstein, was a loyal lieutenant, who joined the governor and members of his inner circle at events outside of work.\nContinue reading the main story Mr. Wildstein mentioned the lanes as a source of leverage. Ms. Kelly called a young employee and instructed him to confirm that Mr. Sokolich had refrained from an endorsement, then emailed Mr. Wildstein: “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.”\nThat was mid-August. In the coming days, she confirmed again that Mr. Sokolich would not endorse.\nAnd she instructed her employees not to “interact” with him.\nPhoto Bill Baroni was appointed by Mr. Christie to the Port Authority. Credit Chris Pedota/The Record, via Associated Press A week later Mr. Wildstein and Ms. Kelly joked in their text messages about punishing a rabbi who had also fallen into disfavor. “We cannot cause traffic problems in front of his house, can we?” Ms. Kelly wrote.\n“Flights to Tel Aviv all mysteriously delayed,” Mr. Wildstein countered.\n“Perfect,” she replied.\nThe three then made up a cover story: They would say that they were doing a traffic study so that unwitting Port Authority staff members would go along with the plan, making it appear to be legitimate. That would require some planning and the involvement of unwitting participants.\nMr. Wildstein had a traffic engineer prepare several configurations; Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly agreed that the one that funneled three access lanes into a single one would inflict the worst punishment on the mayor, by creating the most severe traffic backup on the streets of Fort Lee. They would steer that lane to a tollbooth that accepted cash as well as E-ZPass; there would be no access to the E-ZPass-only lane that offered a faster commute.\nThey were ready in August, but Mr. Baroni recommended waiting. After all, traffic tended to be lighter in summer; “the punitive impact would be lessened,” the indictment says. They bided their time. They agreed: They would do it the first day of school, Monday, Sept. 9, 2013, in order to “intensify Mayor Sokolich’s punishment.”\nThey agreed not to tell him, or any officials in Fort Lee, so that there would be no time to prepare. It would also, the indictment says, “keep Fort Lee residents and G.W.B. commuters from altering their routes.”\nAnd though the three had agreed on the date, they also agreed not to share it with any Port Authority workers involved in the closings until the Friday before, to avoid any leaks.\nThey understood that closing down lanes to the world’s busiest bridge would not be uncomplicated, or inexpensive.\nMr. Wildstein brought in a backup toll collector who had to be paid overtime, in case the one on duty had to go the bathroom.\nHe had traffic engineers rush that Friday to collect data for a fake traffic study. The police would have to work through an extended evening rush.\nContinue reading the main story OPEN Document Document: Indictment Against Baroni and Kelly in George Washington Bridge Scandal It is this use, or misuse, of government resources that is at the heart of the case against the three.\nThey instructed employees at the governor’s office and the Port Authority to direct any complaints from Mr. Sokolich, or public safety officials in Fort Lee, to Mr. Baroni.\nMr. Baroni, the three agreed, would “deliberately ignore” them.\nMr. Wildstein visited the bridge himself the first day, reporting back that the plan was a success: Traffic in Fort Lee was a disaster.\nContinue reading the main story Continue reading the main story Then came the mayor’s desperation. Mr. Baroni got an email saying Mr. Sokolich had called him regarding “an urgent matter of public safety.”\nMr. Wildstein instructed Mr. Baroni: “Radio silence.”\n“Did he call him back?” Ms. Kelly texted Mr. Wildstein later.\n“Radio silence” Mr. Wildstein replied, along with a joke about another mayor who had been punished with a round of canceled meetings with top Christie staff members after he, too had declined to endorse. Ms. Kelly thanked him.\nAnother call. Emergency workers stuck in the gridlock could not respond to calls. A missing toddler. An elderly woman in cardiac arrest (she later died.)\nRadio silence. Ms. Kelly conferred with Mr. Baroni and Mr. Wildstein; the traffic jam was a success, and they would continue.\nThe mayor became more frantic, sending two text messages to Mr. Baroni the next morning. He used phrases like “total gridlock,” “a town ready to revolt,” “rather urgent” and “maddening.”\nContinue reading the main story OPEN Document Document: Indictment of David Wildstein Mr. Baroni simply forwarded them to Mr. Wildstein, who shared them with Ms. Kelly.\n“Is it wrong that I am smiling?” she texted back.\nTwo more emails to Mr. Baroni; the mayor was calling his office, it was a “life/safety issue.”\nHe ignored those, too, instead agreeing during a phone conversation with Ms. Kelly and Mr. Wildstein to keep going. They agreed again in a similar conference call the next day, Sept. 11, and again on Sept. 12, even after Mr. Sokolich begged him in an email marked “PERSONAL.”\nIn underlined text, Mr. Sokolich wrote, “Unquestionably, this decision has negatively impacted public safety here in Fort Lee.” Port Authority police, he said, were telling irate drivers the “debacle is the result of a decision that I, as the mayor, recently made.”\nAgain, Mr. Baroni simply forwarded the message to Mr. Wildstein, who shared it with Ms. Kelly. He did the same with a text message from the mayor later in the day. And when a Port Authority staff member asked Mr. Baroni if he should contact the mayor, Mr. Baroni instructed him not to.\nBy this time, the mayor was calling the governor’s office, and a reporter was calling the Port Authority.\nMr. Wildstein and Ms. Kelly conferred on an anodyne news release. In response to an email from one of her staff members outlining the mayor’s call about “horrendous” traffic, Ms. Kelly replied, “Good.”\nThe morning of Sept. 13 brought a surprise: The executive director of the Port Authority, appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, had heard about the lane closings and ordered them reversed.\nMr. Baroni was furious. He demanded that they be reinstated, saying it was important to “Trenton.” The executive director refused.\nRadio silence continued. But in the coming days, Mr. Baroni and Mr. Wildstein themselves grew frantic, pressing Ms. Kelly on how they should respond.\nIn November, when Mr. Baroni was called to testify before a legislative inquiry into the lane closings, the three drafted a statement asserting that they had been part of a traffic study.\nMr. Baroni went further. “Given the amount of time I’ve spent building a relationship with Mark Sokolich,” he told legislators, the traffic debacle had been “hugely problematic personally.”",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story MEXICO CITY — A Mexican military helicopter was shot down Friday in southwestern Mexico , killing three soldiers and wounding several others during an outbreak of violence in the region that left banks and gas stations ablaze and residents hunkering indoors, military and regional officials said. An armed group in a rural area of Jalisco State fired on the helicopter, forcing it to make an emergency landing. The army said in a statement that three soldiers died, three were missing and 12 others aboard were wounded, but it was not clear if their injuries were from gunfire, which damaged the tail rotor, or the landing. It was a rare fatal attack on a military aircraft, though several have been strafed or forced to land because of mechanical mishaps as Mexico has stepped up their use in recent years to battle organized crime groups. Violence erupted in four southwestern states early Friday as federal forces cracked down on a major drug gang. In Jalisco, 11 banks and 16 gasoline stations were set on fire and nearly 30 roadblock were formed by flaming vehicles, many of them in the Guadalajara metropolitan area, the country’s second-largest. A total of seven people, including the soldiers, were reported killed, and 15 people were arrested, while the governor of the state, Aristóteles Sandoval, declared a “red alert” and appealed for calm. “The whole government is active,” he said in a post on Twitter. “Security in the state is being redoubled.” The American Consulate in Guadalajara issued a warning to its employees to stay in their homes; Friday was a holiday in Mexico, Labor Day, when many people normally flock to vacation spots. One of them, Puerto Vallarta, on the Pacific Coast in Jalisco, reported fires as well, though they did not appear to be near resorts. The state and federal governments had announced an operation aimed at rooting out the leaders of powerful drug gangs, in particular the Jalisco New Generation, which has been blamed for a series of attacks and ambushes on the police and military as it gains supremacy in a region long a battle zone for gangs. Five members of the federal police’s elite Gendarmerie unit were killed in an ambush in March, its first losses since it was formed last year with much fanfare, and last month 15 state police officers were attacked and killed, one of the highest tolls on security forces in the past few years. The wave of violence follows other outbreaks in recent months, including gun battles last month in Tamaulipas State, along the border with Texas, and the abduction last fall of 43 college students, who the authorities say were later killed and burned to ashes by a drug gang working in league with local police officers. A report by the Justice in Mexico project at the University of San Diego said that homicides had declined in Mexico in the past three years, including an estimated 9 percent to 15 percent in 2014, though it noted that reliable figures were difficult to come by because of discrepancies among the census bureau and security agencies on how murders are tallied. “Even amid the overall reduction in violence, there were serious security crises in central and Pacific states,” the report said, adding that Jalisco is among the states that “have emerged as new trouble spots in Mexico’s battle against organized crime.” Loading...",

      "text": "OPEN Timeline “Yes,” Mr. Wildstein answered. “Did you, Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly decide that no prior notice be given to Mayor Sokolich, the chief of police or the residents of Fort Lee?” Judge Wigenton asked. “Yes,” he said. Mr. Wildstein’s lawyer said his client “deeply regrets” what occurred. He said that Mr. Wildstein could not undo what had been done, but that he could “shed truth on what occurred during the course of that week, what led to the events and what ensued thereafter.” Each count that Mr. Wildstein pleaded guilty to carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. But Mr. Fishman said his client was very cooperative with investigators and would almost certainly not face a punishment that severe. If convicted, Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly face higher maximum penalties but would likely not be sentenced to them. For three months, officials said the lane closings had been part of a traffic study. That story was discredited by bridge workers in testimony before the State Legislature in December 2013. Mr. Wildstein resigned as the director of interstate capital projects at the Port Authority. The scandal blew open a month later after documents that had been subpoenaed by the Legislature were leaked, including the now-infamous email from Ms. Kelly . \nReporting was contributed by Michael Barbaro, Russ Buettner, Jason Grant, Alan Rappeport and Nate Schweber. \nFor more coverage, read our live updates here and follow us on Twitter and Facebook.

      "text": "OPEN Map The effects of Katmandu’s uncontrolled growth are distilled in Gongabu, where dozens of buildings collapsed and others slipped off their foundations and onto their sides. The neighborhood has grown helter-skelter in recent years into an enclave for poorer workers, tourists and people abandoning the mountains for the city. Its identity is so caught up in Katmandu’s wild expansion that it is nicknamed New Bus Park, for the neighborhood’s long-distance bus terminal, where many migrants first arrive. The area is a maze of four-, five- and six-story buildings — mainly shops, guesthouses that cater to poor Nepalis traveling to and from Katmandu for work and business, and small apartment buildings, often with small shops on their ground floors. Residents said bribery to allow illegal construction was common, and land-use planning unheard-of. “The buildings are taller and taller, but they want to save money on making them,” said Sumah Thapa, a stocky 30-year-old who makes a living selling tickets at the nearby bus station. Photo The Boudhanath Stupa, center, one of the oldest Buddhist monuments in the Himalayas, four days after the earthquake. Credit Manish Swarup/Associated Press When the earthquake struck on Saturday, residents rushed onto the main street to escape the swaying buildings. But many did not make it. Officials would not say how many people in the area had died, though residents offered estimates ranging from dozens to hundreds. “Most of the buildings, I believe, they have not been built in compliance with the standard required,” said Yogeshwar Krishna Parajuli , the chief development commissioner of the Katmandu Valley Development Authority , which covers an area including the city of Katmandu. “They were constructed very superficially.” Continue reading the main story Residents checked off the particular sins, saying regulations on building height and construction materials were regularly ignored, as were specifications for safety features like pillars. “Fourteen years ago, it was fields of vegetables, barley, potatoes,” said Jit Bahadur Limbu, a shop owner and longtime resident. “But now, even if our government doesn’t give permission, people make five- to seven-story buildings.” He added, “The builder or your engineer pays the inspector to not make trouble and then gives you the bill.” He and other residents estimated that bribes ranged from a few dollars to a few hundred, depending on the size of the project. Mr. Khadwada, the guesthouse owner, said that several years ago, through his building contractor, he had paid inspectors about $150 so they would turn a blind eye to two extra floors built on top of his guesthouse, in addition to the two permitted by construction codes. Days after the earthquake, many residents of New Bus Park remained in tents outside their homes and scoffed at the government’s suggestion that most houses in Katmandu were safe enough for them to move back indoors at night. “I’m still scared,” said Mr. Suwal, the trekking guide. “We will have to move back into our homes, but maybe the house is too weak for the next time. Can they tell us?” \nGardiner Harris contributed reporting from New Delhi.

      "text": " LAS VEGAS — Boxing is admirable in its primal beauty. The best fighters are ferocious athletes, tacticians with the endurance of marathon runners.\nThey work amid broken noses, bruised organs, and head shots that send the brain rattling from one side of its casing to the other. You hope for your man to knock the other man senseless, and the sooner the better. A right cross below the heart, a left hook, and bye-bye.\nFloyd Mayweather Jr. , who on Saturday will meet Manny Pacquiao in a money swamp of a championship welterweight bout, is a master of this predator’s ecosystem. He swings an executioner’s ax and drops opponents with startling ease.\n“Fighters aren’t scared of each other,” Freddie Roach, Pacquiao’s trainer, noted. “That isn’t part of the sport.”\nIt is a reasonable bet, however, that the girlfriends, wives and children of Mayweather, a professional fighter with a body like coiled iron, view fear in a different light.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage In Mayweather-Pacquiao Buildup, Surprisingly Little Fight in the Fighters APRIL 30, 2015 A Sports Fan’s Guide to a Delicious Saturday MAY 1, 2015 On Boxing: Mayweather-Pacquiao Is an Easy Sell; Boxing Isn’t APRIL 28, 2015 TV Sports: A Pay-Per-View Knockout Unites Two Rival Networks APRIL 27, 2015 There is another face to the man known as Pretty Boy, or Money, or T.B.E., his acronym for The Best Ever. He is the established best fighter of his time and an established, serial batterer of women.\nTo take just one data point among many: At 4 a.m. on Sept. 9, 2010, Mayweather and a friend came into the house of Josie Harris, mother to three of his children. He was not affectionate. Mayweather questioned Harris about dating another man (Mayweather at the time was himself with another woman). He threatened to make her disappear.\nThen, with those leaden fists, he struck with a champion’s ferocity in the back of her head. He pulled her off the couch and twisted her left arm. All of this comes from court papers.\nMayweather’s preadolescent sons, Koraun and Zion, heard their mother’s cries and ran into the room. Pretty Boy growled at Zion: You call 911 or run out of the house, and I’ll “beat you.” He also threatened to beat Koraun.\nKoraun wrote a statement for the police in block letters: “I saw my dad was on my mom said go to the office he was hiting my mom.”\nTo extrapolate an indictment of boxing from the misdeeds of a single fighter is unfair. Boxing is a naturally brutal sport; not all pugilists are naturally brutal. Some are strikingly gentle outside of the ring, and most of those men appear to carry that manner behind the closed doors of family life too.\nSports of The Times A collection of columns offering opinion and analysis from the world of sports.

      "text": "OPEN Timeline The charges reveal the step-by-step, carefully coordinated attention paid by the three associates of the governor to create the perfect traffic jam, a veritable town-size parking lot, one that in the end may have stymied Mr. Christie’s presidential ambitions. Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly have proclaimed their innocence, saying that Mr. Wildstein, who is cooperating with the authorities, fabricated stories about their actions to help his case. The hinge of the plot Mr. Wildstein has outlined for the authorities was a uniquely New Jersey form of punishment: making suburban drivers sit in traffic. The first mention of it came in March 2011, as Mr. Christie’s star among national Republicans was first rising. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Wildstein, then the chief of staff to Mr. Baroni, Mr. Christie’s top staff appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , mentioned to Mr. Baroni that they could use the local access lanes to the bridge from Fort Lee as leverage against the town’s mayor, Mark Sokolich. Mr. Christie’s strategists were hoping to use his 2013 re-election campaign to build a case for him to run for president. Their goal was to secure endorsements from a broad spectrum of officials, including Democrats such as Mayor Sokolich. This cultivating fell mostly to young staff members in the wing of Mr. Christie’s front office known as Intergovernmental Affairs. In August 2013, Ms. Kelly, the deputy chief of staff in that office, expressed disappointment to Mr. Wildstein that Mr. Sokolich, who had been the subject of intense wooing by her office and the authority, was not going to endorse Mr. Christie. Ms. Kelly, like Mr. Baroni and Mr. Wildstein, was a loyal lieutenant, who joined the governor and members of his inner circle at events outside of work. Continue reading the main story Mr. Wildstein mentioned the lanes as a source of leverage. Ms. Kelly called a young employee and instructed him to confirm that Mr. Sokolich had refrained from an endorsement, then emailed Mr. Wildstein: “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.” That was mid-August. In the coming days, she confirmed again that Mr. Sokolich would not endorse. And she instructed her employees not to “interact” with him. Photo Bill Baroni was appointed by Mr. Christie to the Port Authority. Credit Chris Pedota/The Record, via Associated Press A week later Mr. Wildstein and Ms. Kelly joked in their text messages about punishing a rabbi who had also fallen into disfavor. “We cannot cause traffic problems in front of his house, can we?” Ms. Kelly wrote. “Flights to Tel Aviv all mysteriously delayed,” Mr. Wildstein countered. “Perfect,” she replied. The three then made up a cover story: They would say that they were doing a traffic study so that unwitting Port Authority staff members would go along with the plan, making it appear to be legitimate. That would require some planning and the involvement of unwitting participants. Mr. Wildstein had a traffic engineer prepare several configurations; Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly agreed that the one that funneled three access lanes into a single one would inflict the worst punishment on the mayor, by creating the most severe traffic backup on the streets of Fort Lee. They would steer that lane to a tollbooth that accepted cash as well as E-ZPass; there would be no access to the E-ZPass-only lane that offered a faster commute. They were ready in August, but Mr. Baroni recommended waiting. After all, traffic tended to be lighter in summer; “the punitive impact would be lessened,” the indictment says. They bided their time. They agreed: They would do it the first day of school, Monday, Sept. 9, 2013, in order to “intensify Mayor Sokolich’s punishment.” They agreed not to tell him, or any officials in Fort Lee, so that there would be no time to prepare. It would also, the indictment says, “keep Fort Lee residents and G.W.B. commuters from altering their routes.” And though the three had agreed on the date, they also agreed not to share it with any Port Authority workers involved in the closings until the Friday before, to avoid any leaks. They understood that closing down lanes to the world’s busiest bridge would not be uncomplicated, or inexpensive. Mr. Wildstein brought in a backup toll collector who had to be paid overtime, in case the one on duty had to go the bathroom. He had traffic engineers rush that Friday to collect data for a fake traffic study. The police would have to work through an extended rush hour.",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story LONDON — Lo, and it came to pass at last on Saturday morning, unto Kate, who was late, a child was born – a baby girl, who will be fourth in line to the British throne. There was much rejoicing in the land, especially among the many who had placed their bets on a girl, while others await a further windfall, if they guess right on what name will be chosen. Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, “was safely delivered of a daughter” at 8:34 a.m. London time, Kensington Palace announced. The birth came less than three hours after she was admitted to the hospital where in July 2013 she gave birth to Prince George , so according to some British press, she and her husband will get a 10 percent “loyalty discount” for her expensive hospital suite. The new baby weighs 8 pounds 3 ounces, the palace said, adding that mother and daughter are both doing well, and that father William, the Duke of Cambridge, was present for the birth of the child, who will be known as the Princess of Cambridge. Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, had made it clear he was hoping for a granddaughter, and the child is the fifth great-grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II. The statement said that senior royals have been informed, and “are delighted with the news.” The pending birth and uncertainty about the gender have been a boon for Britain’s bookmakers, who say they received thousands of bets on the newborn’s gender and possible name. Betting was partly suspended after Saturday’s announcement, though wagers were still being placed on a name. Alice and Charlotte are the clear favorites, followed by Elizabeth, Victoria and Diana — all names with strong connections to royal tradition. In 2013, the announcement of George’s name came two days after his birth. The bookies are also busy with bets on Thursday’s British election , which is one of the tightest in memory. The birth is likely to draw attention away from the politicians, which may be a relief to everyone in what has been a longer campaign than usual. Kate, 33, who wed William, 32, in April 2011 , had an April delivery date, she told friends. Royal watchers, fans and television camera operators have been lining up for days outside the Lindo wing at St. Mary’s Hospital. Loading... ",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story BALTIMORE — The city is bracing for more protests this weekend, following a tumultuous week that included looting and arson, the arrival of National Guard troops and the filing of criminal charges against six police officers in the case of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man whose death in police custody set off the unrest. Thousands of people are expected here Saturday for a march organized by Malik Shabazz, president of the Washington-based Black Lawyers for Justice and a former chairman of the New Black Panther Party. For nearly two weeks, ever since Mr. Gray died, city leaders have been warning against “outside agitators,” an oblique reference to Mr. Shabazz, who is clearly making them nervous. “They should be nervous,” Mr. Shabazz said in an interview Friday night. “The youth went off and had a rebellion because the established leadership has not represented them well.” Protesters are expected to gather late Saturday morning in two spots: at the Gilmor Homes in northwest Baltimore where Mr. Gray was arrested, and also at City Hall, where Mr. Shabazz said he will give a “keynote address” at 3 p.m., as part of a mass rally that will begin at 2 p.m. and is scheduled to end at 6 p.m. Mr. Shabazz, 46, who has led similar protests in cities like Ferguson, Mo., and Charleston, S.C., has been labeled “an extremist” by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which calls him a “racist black nationalist” who is “particularly skilled at orchestrating provocative protests.” A march he led here last Saturday turned briefly violent after he urged protesters at a City Hall rally to “shut it down!” Mr. Shabazz said afterward, and again on Friday, that he was calling only for civil disobedience, not violence, but added that he is not surprised by the riots that tore through Baltimore earlier this week. “The rebellion was brewing before I got here, and the rebellion was going to happen whether I got here or not,” he said. Community activists and black religious leaders, including the Rev. Jamal Bryant, pastor of the Empowerment Temple, have said they will stay away from Saturday’s march; Rev. Bryant is planning his own rally at City Hall on Sunday. Melech Thomas, a divinity student and youth pastor, also said he will not attend. Mr. Thomas said he has no objection to Mr. Shabazz, though he added, “It would be nice to actually see him at some of the community meetings we’ve had this week, and I can’t say that I have.” With the National Guard still patrolling the streets, and a 10 p.m. citywide curfew in place, officials expect that this Saturday will be more peaceful than last. And the city’s mood shifted dramatically on Friday after Marilyn J. Mosby , the local prosecutor for the city of Baltimore, announced that six police officers would face charges, including murder and manslaughter. Ms. Mosby’s announcement set off a wave of jubilation in some black neighborhoods, prompting some to predict that Saturday’s events would be more celebration than protest. “She probably saved the city from a lot of stress that it didn’t need to go through,” said A. Dwight Pettit, a lawyer, who represents people accusing the police of misconduct. Loading... ",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story BALTIMORE — The city is bracing for more protests this weekend, following a tumultuous week that included looting and arson, the arrival of National Guard troops and the filing of criminal charges against six police officers in the case of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man whose death in police custody set off the unrest. Thousands of people are expected here Saturday for a march organized by Malik Shabazz, president of the Washington-based Black Lawyers for Justice and a former chairman of the New Black Panther Party. For nearly two weeks, ever since Mr. Gray died, city leaders have been warning against “outside agitators,” an oblique reference to Mr. Shabazz, who is clearly making them nervous. “They should be nervous,” Mr. Shabazz said in an interview Friday night. “The youth went off and had a rebellion because the established leadership has not represented them well.” Protesters are expected to gather late Saturday morning in two spots: at the Gilmor Homes in northwest Baltimore where Mr. Gray was arrested, and also at City Hall, where Mr. Shabazz said he will give a “keynote address” at 3 p.m., as part of a mass rally that will begin at 2 p.m. and is scheduled to end at 6 p.m. Mr. Shabazz, 46, who has led similar protests in cities like Ferguson, Mo., and Charleston, S.C., has been labeled “an extremist” by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which calls him a “racist black nationalist” with a “well-documented history of violently anti-semitic remarks and accusations about the inherent evil of white people” who is “particularly skilled at orchestrating provocative protests.” A march he led here last Saturday turned briefly violent after he urged protesters at a City Hall rally to “shut it down!” Mr. Shabazz said afterward, and again on Friday, that he was calling only for civil disobedience, not violence, but added that he is not surprised by the riots that tore through Baltimore earlier this week. “The rebellion was brewing before I got here, and the rebellion was going to happen whether I got here or not,” he said. Community activists and black religious leaders, including the Rev. Jamal Bryant, pastor of the Empowerment Temple, have said they will stay away from Saturday’s march; Rev. Bryant is planning his own rally at City Hall on Sunday. Melech Thomas, a divinity student and youth pastor, also said he will not attend. Mr. Thomas said he has no objection to Mr. Shabazz, though he added, “It would be nice to actually see him at some of the community meetings we’ve had this week, and I can’t say that I have.” With the National Guard still patrolling the streets, and a 10 p.m. citywide curfew in place, officials expect that this Saturday will be more peaceful than last. And the city’s mood shifted dramatically on Friday after Marilyn J. Mosby , the local prosecutor for the city of Baltimore, announced that six police officers would face charges, including murder and manslaughter. Ms. Mosby’s announcement set off a wave of jubilation in some black neighborhoods, prompting some to predict that Saturday’s events would be more celebration than protest. “She probably saved the city from a lot of stress that it didn’t need to go through,” said A. Dwight Pettit, a lawyer, who represents people accusing the police of misconduct. Loading...",

      "text": "FEB. 4, 2014 The team leaders thought this augmented reality product had the potential to be the next big thing in consumer technology, as groundbreaking as the PC and the smartphone. But this was Microsoft, the company that had managed, time and again, to take ingenious innovation and bungle it on the way to store shelves. Microsoft had its software on smartphones years before Apple released the iPhone. Few cared. A full decade before the Apple Watch, Microsoft introduced its own computer on a wrist. It did not take off. Photo Steven Bathiche, right, a Microsoft researcher who is part of the Surface tablet team, and Flavio Ribeiro, also a researcher. Credit Peter DiCampo for The New York Times The HoloLens team members were confident in their creation. But they worried that Mr. Nadella, a two-decade Microsoft employee then looking at cost-cutting measures and mass layoffs, would kill it for being too risky and far-out. Mr. Nadella didn’t flinch. “He said right away, ‘This is something that we’re going to do,’ ” Mr. Holmdahl said. “We are going to create a new product category, and this is the type of thing that Microsoft should be working on.” That response says a lot about the reshaped Microsoft Mr. Nadella envisions — one with fewer internal fiefs and with more willingness to favor big bets on new technologies over protecting legacy cash cows. Part of that rebuilding occurred at a Microsoft conference that started on Wednesday in San Francisco, where he sought to mend Microsoft’s frayed relationship with software developers, making it easier for them to convert apps written for Apple and Google’s mobile operating systems to run on Windows. In a recent interview, Mr. Nadella, 47, said he and the company had learned from its past mistakes. His Microsoft understands, he says, the discipline needed to build products that look and feel polished. Every part, from hardware to software to online services, must work in harmony. “One lesson learned is you’ve got to finish the scenario with excellence,” said Mr. Nadella, who speaks in verbal arpeggios, emphasizing points with octave-leaping sentences. “You just cannot stop. You have to complete this, and I think that’s where Apple has taught us all what experience excellence means in the creation of categories.” In some ways, Microsoft is already a different place from the infamously balkanized one Mr. Nadella inherited from Steven A. Ballmer in February 2014. Not long ago, the company had about a half-dozen internal systems for managing the development of software; Mr. Nadella is pushing everyone to use a single one, in the belief that top-notch internal tools will help it create top-notch products. Continue reading the main story He has taken up an effort started under Mr. Ballmer to end the factional strife inside Microsoft, making the 118,000-strong work force nimbler. He has rallied them around mantras, like making personal computing more personal through wearables and other devices. To better translate Microsoft’s innovation into products people want to buy, he has directed the company’s research group, the biggest in the technology industry, to work more closely with product engineers. And just as important, Mr. Nadella has shown a sense of humility. Mr. Ballmer once laughed at the iPhone in a television interview. Mr. Nadella, in contrast, has aggressively pushed Microsoft’s Office software onto Apple and Android devices — the very devices that have eroded Microsoft’s influence. “Their arrogance consumed them,” said Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce.com, a longtime critic of Microsoft whose company reached an agreement to cooperate on software integration with Microsoft last year. “Now with Satya, they have a much more open mind about working with people.” Still, given the company’s history, there is plenty of skepticism about whether Mr. Nadella can pull off a hit with HoloLens and other inventive products starting to trickle out of the Microsoft pipeline. Analysts have been impressed with Mr. Nadella’s fast-growing cloud computing business, and the company’s stock, up almost 40 percent since he took over, is hovering near a 15-year high. But he hasn’t yet shown whether Microsoft can deliver an earthshaking new technology. At the meeting about HoloLens, Mr. Nadella told the team how he wanted the project to proceed. It was not going to be organized like Xbox, the company’s video game system, which developed as a semiautonomous republic. He wanted the group to be fully integrated into Microsoft. That meant collaborating with people developing Skype, the company’s online voice and videoconferencing service, as well as the Windows and video games teams. The HoloLens group had already started moving in this direction even before the meeting with Mr. Nadella, but his orders galvanized them. Microsoft says HoloLens will go on sale “in the time frame” when Windows 10, its new operating system, is released this summer. In other words, the HoloLens is only a crucible for the new borderless Microsoft Mr. Nadella is seeking to create. No pressure. ‘A Decent Batting Average’ There is a short list of big technology companies that have staged comebacks that restored them to their former glory. Arguably, that list contains just one name: Apple. Microsoft, which passed the 40th anniversary of its founding in April, is an easy target for critics because its golden era, the 1990s, was eons ago on the digital calendar. For today’s young entrepreneurs and software developers, it’s hard to believe the Microsoft of 2015, defanged by antitrust battles and strategic missteps, once ruled the industry. It’s also easy to overstate Microsoft’s problems. With $22 billion in profit last year, $87 billion in revenue and a cash pile over $95 billion, it often trades places with Google as the second most valuable technology company in the world after Apple. Windows and the Office suite of productivity software continue to print money, especially from corporate customers, despite a spate of premature obituaries. While Mr. Ballmer was harshly criticized for his tin ear on technology, more than a dozen new products released under his watch exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Imposing, yes, but Microsoft is rarely named among the future-defining tech companies of today, especially when it comes to the consumer businesses. It is nearly always an afterthought following Amazon, Apple ,Google and Facebook. In the interview in early April, Mr. Nadella argued that Microsoft’s misses should be put in perspective. Photo Steven Bathiche demonstrates PixelSense, his invention that led to Microsoft's Surface tablet. Credit Peter DiCampo for The New York Times “What gets lost is we wouldn’t be who we are and as successful as we have been if we didn’t have a decent batting average,” Mr. Nadella said, sitting on a couch in the same understated and window-lined office once occupied by Mr. Ballmer and, before that, Bill Gates. “I think we would be dead and gone if we were just mostly failing. It’s just that our average in the last five years has not been as great as, let’s say, Apple’s.” Mr. Nadella pointed in particular to tablet computers. Relying for years on other companies to build all tablets running Windows, he says, led to poor products. Now, the company is heavily advertising the Surface, a tablet that Microsoft designs and builds. Of course, it’s one thing to make hardware and another thing to make good hardware. Attention to detail, so crucial in today’s hardware market, has not been Microsoft’s strongest suit. When Microsoft first introduced the Surface several years ago, the company did not have a touch-screen-friendly version of its Office applications — the hugely popular programs like Word and PowerPoint — ready to go at the start. It was a bit like trying to sell a car with one wheel missing. A similar problem arose last year, shortly after Mr. Nadella became chief executive. The team working on a new version of Surface was frustrated that it took multiple steps — start the device, enter a password, open an app called OneNote — before a user could start taking notes on the tablet with a stylus. “By the time you’re done, you probably would have said, ‘I just would have wrote this down on a piece of paper,’ ” said Steven Bathiche, a Microsoft researcher who is now part of the Surface team. Hardware and software groups were unable to resolve their conflicts, each fearing that changes would throw them off schedule. Mr. Nadella was not pleased. “You’re not going to ship this without making it work,” Mr. Nadella responded at the time. “One of the advantages of being C.E.O. is you say things like that and people rise to the occasion,” he said. By the time the Surface shipped, you could click one button on the stylus to start taking notes. Translating Innovation Into Sales A big part of Microsoft’s fate rests with its research arm, the quasi-academic group responsible for conjuring breakthroughs that will keep Microsoft relevant for generations to come. On Monday, Harry Shum, the Microsoft executive vice president who oversees the research operation, was bursting with pride while demonstrating Skype Translator, a new product that incorporates years of work by researchers to convert voice conversations from one language to another in real time. Continue reading the main story Mr. Shum gamely agreed to conduct a portion of an interview using Skype Translator. Mr. Shum sat in his office, and I sat in a conference room down the hall looking at Mr. Shum’s face on a computer screen. I asked questions in English, and Mr. Shum responded in Mandarin, his native tongue. He answered a question in Mandarin about the impact he says Skype Translator can have, and the software spit out an English transcript and synthesized recording seconds later. The software made mistakes — Skype transcribed his name as “Hairy” — but it got the point across. “Today we have a lot of obstacles of communication,” Mr. Shum said, according to the Skype translation. “Because we speak a different language, you speak English, I speak Chinese, if we are not able to understand the two sides, the world would have a lot of problems.” Founded in 1991 by Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft’s chief technology officer at the time, as an early warning system for disruptive new technologies, Microsoft Research occupies a building that has a spacious, multistory atrium, filled with a swirl of employees in T-shirts, jeans and other timeless fashions of tech. It is the biggest operation of its kind in the technology industry, with more than 1,000 scientists and engineers working in labs as far away as China and Israel. The company’s research-and-development spending last year was $11.4 billion. Spending doesn’t guarantee success, however. There is a long history of technology companies fumbling commercial opportunities from research breakthroughs sitting right under their noses. In the 1970s, Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center developed a forerunner of the modern PC, with a graphical user interface and mouse. An outsider who saw it, Steven P. Jobs, was the one who eventually capitalized on the technology with the Apple Macintosh. Mr. Nadella is trying to avoid missed opportunities. He has pushed researchers and product engineers to work closer than ever before. He invited Mr. Shum to attend a regular Wednesday-afternoon meeting of a small group called the product leadership team; Mr. Shum is the first representative from Microsoft Research to participate in the sessions. Inside the old Microsoft, the translation technology could easily have languished as a cool demo and nothing more. Product groups would have been slow to embrace an experimental technology that could introduce new costs not to mention uncertainty into their release schedules. Photo Harry Shum, the executive vice president who oversees Microsoft's research operation. Credit Peter DiCampo for The New York Times “Instead of saying, ‘Hey, let’s see what we can do together,’ you’d say, ‘Well, when you cross this level of accuracy, come and talk to me, then we’ll figure out when we can slot you in,’ ” said Gurdeep Singh Pall, the Microsoft corporate vice president in charge of Skype. Breaking down barriers at Microsoft is still a work in progress, but some executives said the tone had changed markedly. “Skype had every reason to push back,” said Peter Lee, a corporate vice president at Microsoft Research. “But instead Gurdeep, especially, just embraced this.” Continue reading the main story “There’s an eagerness in the business units to pick up ideas that are going to make a significant difference,” said Ed Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, who is on the technical advisory board for Microsoft Research. Mr. Shum, who worked for years as a top engineer on Bing, a distant No. 2 in the search engine market to Google, has seen Microsoft get burned in new technology markets before. “It’s at this very critical moment for the company, and either we build products people love or we will be history,” Mr. Shum said. HoloLens, too, is jammed with technologies that started in Microsoft Research, including the display technology used to paint virtual images on lenses in front of people’s eyes. It uses cameras developed by Microsoft researchers and first used in Kinect, an Xbox accessory, to map a person’s surroundings so virtual objects stay where they’re supposed to. Slick hardware, though, will go only so far. If HoloLens has any chance of becoming a breakout hit, it will need must-have applications — add-ons that will do for augmented reality what wildly popular services like Instagram and Snapchat have done for smartphones. Changing the Game At the Microsoft conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, the company showed examples of how HoloLens will be used. In one, a medical school expects to adopt HoloLens to let students learn anatomy. In another, a building developer plans to have clients explore finished architecture while on a project still in construction. Those examples fill nice niches, but they certainly don’t scream mass market. For that, Microsoft is turning partly to games. In September, Microsoft paid $2.5 billion for Minecraft, the video game played by tens of millions of people. By January, the logic behind the purchase started to become a little clearer when the company showed the game on HoloLens. In Minecraft, players can build and destroy structures, sort of like playing virtual Legos. With the HoloLens, the game is no longer confined to a smartphone or a computer screen, though. Players wearing the headset can decorate the surfaces of a room with Minecraft blocks, then destroy them, if they like. In the demonstration Microsoft showed, it was possible to build on a coffee table, then crush it to expose a cave below. Mr. Nadella said HoloLens was a big reason for buying Minecraft. “Let’s have a game that, in fact, will fundamentally help us change new categories,” Mr. Nadella said. “HoloLens was very much in the works then, and we knew it.” At least one thing is certain: Microsoft will have a lot of competition. Magic Leap, a closely watched start-up that Google has invested in, is developing an augmented-reality device. Virtual-reality headsets from Oculus, owned by Facebook, Valve and Sony, which envelop users with virtual environments, are also on the way. There is also little evidence so far that the public is clamoring to don a headpiece and wear it for hours. Google Glass is a cautionary tale. The company has pulled back significantly on its aspirations for that computer-in-your-face product, as least for now. Continue reading the main story Doubters have already lined up with HoloLens, certain that Microsoft will once again trip over itself. The product looks as if it will be far more expensive than smartphones, which benefit from subsidies from wireless carriers that lower their initial cost. One current Microsoft executive said HoloLens would cost significantly more than a game console, which runs more than $400. Even if Mr. Nadella and other top executives have recognized the need for change, there are still pockets of resistance. Rahul Sood, who ran a venture capital fund inside Microsoft until November, praised Mr. Nadella for changing Microsoft, but said there wasn’t enough risk-taking below him. “The part making that harder is there is a big layer of middle management,” said Mr. Sood, who founded Unikrn, a start-up based in Seattle that is focused on competitive gaming. “I think it’s slowly changing. I think they need more entrepreneurs in the company.” Even Mr. Nadella hints at uncertainty when discussing the kind of impact HoloLens will have. “I don’t want to overhype it like Google Glass and say this is the next,” he says, trailing off. “I want us to be deliberate about what it is.” At least with HoloLens, Microsoft appears to be skating to where the puck could be headed in technology, rather than where it has been. Brad Silverberg, a venture capitalist in Seattle and a former senior executive at Microsoft, said he was encouraged that the company was doing that rather than playing catch-up in smartphones. “That battle is already fought and lost,” Mr. Silverberg said. “You’ve got to change the game.” A version of this article appears in print on May 3, 2015, on page BU1 of the New York edition with the headline: Microsoft’s Far-Out Vision.

      "text": "Read a full explanation of our methodology. Rankings reflect sales reported by vendors offering a wide range of general interest titles. The sales venues for print books include independent book retailers; national, regional and local chains; online and multimedia entertainment retailers; supermarkets, university, gift and discount department stores; and newsstands. E-book rankings reflect sales from leading online vendors of e-books in a variety of popular e-reader formats. E book sales are presently included for all adult categories (fiction, non-fiction and advice) except for graphic novels, and all children's categories with the exception of picture books. Titles are included regardless of whether they are published in both print and electronic formats or just one format. E-books available exclusively from a single vendor will be tracked at a future date. The universe of print book dealers is well established, and sales of print titles are statistically weighted to represent all outlets nationwide. The universe of e-book publishers and vendors is rapidly emerging, and until the industry is settled sales of e-books will not be weighted. Among the categories not actively tracked at this time are: perennial sellers, required classroom reading, textbooks, reference and test preparation guides, journals, workbooks, calorie counters, shopping guides, comics, crossword puzzles and self-published books. The appearance of a ranked title reflects the fact that sales data from reporting vendors has been provided to The Times and has satisfied commonly accepted industry standards of universal identification (such as ISBN13 and EISBN13 codes). Publishers and vendors of all ranked titles conformed in timely fashion to The New York Times Best Seller Lists requirement to allow for independent corroboration of sales for that week. Publisher credits for e-books are listed under the corporate publishing name instead of by publisher's division. Sales of both print books and e-books are reported confidentially to The New York Times. The Best Seller Lists are prepared by the News Surveys and Election Analysis Department of The New York Times. Royalty Share, a firm that provides accounting services to publishers, is assisting The Times in its corroboration of e-book sales. An asterisk (*) indicates that a book's sales are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A dagger (†) indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders. ",

      "text": "OPEN Timeline The charges reveal the step-by-step, carefully coordinated attention paid by the three associates of the governor to create the perfect traffic jam, a veritable town-size parking lot, one that in the end may have stymied Mr. Christie’s presidential ambitions. Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly have proclaimed their innocence, saying that Mr. Wildstein, who is cooperating with the authorities, fabricated stories about their actions to help his case. The hinge of the plot Mr. Wildstein has outlined for the authorities was a uniquely New Jersey form of punishment: making suburban drivers sit in traffic. The first mention of it came in March 2011, as Mr. Christie’s star among national Republicans was first rising. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Wildstein, then the chief of staff to Mr. Baroni, Mr. Christie’s top staff appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , mentioned to Mr. Baroni that they could use the local access lanes to the bridge from Fort Lee as leverage against the town’s mayor, Mark Sokolich. Mr. Christie’s strategists were hoping to use his 2013 re-election campaign to build a case for him to run for president. Their goal was to secure endorsements from a broad spectrum of officials, including Democrats such as Mayor Sokolich. This cultivating fell mostly to young staff members in the wing of Mr. Christie’s front office known as Intergovernmental Affairs. In August 2013, Ms. Kelly, the deputy chief of staff in that office, expressed disappointment to Mr. Wildstein that Mr. Sokolich, who had been the subject of intense wooing by her office and the authority, was not going to endorse Mr. Christie. Ms. Kelly, like Mr. Baroni and Mr. Wildstein, was a loyal lieutenant, who joined the governor and members of his inner circle at events outside of work. Continue reading the main story Mr. Wildstein mentioned the lanes as a source of leverage. Ms. Kelly called a young employee and instructed him to confirm that Mr. Sokolich had refrained from an endorsement, then emailed Mr. Wildstein: “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.” That was mid-August. In the coming days, she confirmed again that Mr. Sokolich would not endorse. And she instructed her employees not to “interact” with him. Photo Bill Baroni was appointed by Mr. Christie to the Port Authority. Credit Chris Pedota/The Record, via Associated Press A week later Mr. Wildstein and Ms. Kelly joked in their text messages about punishing a rabbi who had also fallen into disfavor. “We cannot cause traffic problems in front of his house, can we?” Ms. Kelly wrote. “Flights to Tel Aviv all mysteriously delayed,” Mr. Wildstein countered. “Perfect,” she replied. The three then made up a cover story: They would say that they were doing a traffic study so that unwitting Port Authority staff members would go along with the plan, making it appear to be legitimate. That would require some planning and the involvement of unwitting participants. Mr. Wildstein had a traffic engineer prepare several configurations; Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly agreed that the one that funneled three access lanes into a single one would inflict the worst punishment on the mayor, by creating the most severe traffic backup on the streets of Fort Lee. They would steer that lane to a tollbooth that accepted cash as well as E-ZPass; there would be no access to the E-ZPass-only lane that offered a faster commute. They were ready in August, but Mr. Baroni recommended waiting. After all, traffic tended to be lighter in summer; “the punitive impact would be lessened,” the indictment says. They bided their time. They agreed: They would do it the first day of school, Monday, Sept. 9, 2013, in order to “intensify Mayor Sokolich’s punishment.” They agreed not to tell him, or any officials in Fort Lee, so that there would be no time to prepare. It would also, the indictment says, “keep Fort Lee residents and G.W.B. commuters from altering their routes.” And though the three had agreed on the date, they also agreed not to share it with any Port Authority workers involved in the closings until the Friday before, to avoid any leaks. They understood that closing down lanes to the world’s busiest bridge would not be uncomplicated, or inexpensive. Mr. Wildstein brought in a backup toll collector who had to be paid overtime, in case the one on duty had to go the bathroom. He had traffic engineers rush that Friday to collect data for a fake traffic study. The police would have to work through an extended rush hour.",

      "text": "  LONDON — Lo, and it came to pass at last on Saturday morning, unto Kate, who was late, a child was born – a baby girl, who will be fourth in line to the British throne. There was much rejoicing in the land, especially among the many who had placed their bets on a girl, while others await a further windfall, if they guess right on what name will be chosen. Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, “was safely delivered of a daughter” at 8:34 a.m. London time, Kensington Palace announced. The birth came less than three hours after she was admitted to the hospital where in July 2013 she gave birth to Prince George , so according to some British press, she and her husband will get a 10 percent “loyalty discount” for her expensive hospital suite. The baby weighs 8 pounds 3 ounces, the palace said, adding that mother and daughter are both doing well, and that father William, the Duke of Cambridge, was present for the birth of the child, who will be known as the Princess of Cambridge. Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, had made it clear he was hoping for a granddaughter, and the child is the fifth great-grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II. The statement said that senior royals had been informed, and “are delighted with the news.” The impending birth was a boon for Britain’s bookmakers, who say they received thousands of bets on the newborn’s gender and possible name. Betting was partly suspended after Saturday’s announcement, though wagers were still being placed on a name. Alice and Charlotte are the clear favorites, followed by Elizabeth, Victoria and Diana — all names with strong connections to royal tradition. In 2013, the announcement of George’s name came two days after his birth. The bookies are also busy with bets on Thursday’s British election , which is one of the tightest in memory. The birth is likely to draw attention away from the politicians, which may be a relief to everyone in what has been a longer campaign than usual.

      "text": "http://nyti.ms/1JRVRmL Cover Photo Dante Castiglione, a Bitcoin broker, pays a client in U.S. dollars at a temporary office in Buenos Aires. Credit Mark Peterson/Redux, for The New York Times Can Bitcoin Conquer Argentina? With its volatile currency and dysfunctional banks, the country is the perfect place to experiment with a new digital currency. Continue reading the main story D ante Castiglione stalked through the doors of a glass-walled office tower on the edge of downtown Buenos Aires, just a few hundred feet from the old port district. In the crowded elevator, he shook his head and muttered under his breath about the stresses of the day and his profession. “I swear, this job can kill me,” he said, his eyes cast downward. On the 20th floor, he hustled into an impersonal, windowless office and quickly removed the tools of his trade from his backpack and set them on the desk: locked blue cash box, cellphone and clunky Dell laptop with the same yellow smiley-face sticker that he puts on all his electronics. Then he unbuckled the fanny pack from around his waist, which contained the most important part of his business: bricks of $100 bills and 100-peso notes. This room, rented for the day, was not one of Castiglione’s regular haunts. He mostly drifts among the old cafes in Buenos Aires, where the bow-tie-wearing waiters serve small glasses of seltzer water with each coffee. In his line of business as a money-changer, temporary meeting places are preferred; they make things harder for would-be thieves, whom he has so far avoided. On this Friday in late February, Castiglione had run around the city in his camouflage-patterned sandals, trying to distribute cash to some clients and pick it up from others. Once back in his temporary office, his outdated LG phone alternately chirped, buzzed and sang with incoming text messages and emails. Continue reading the main story Ordinarily, Castiglione would have help. His 18-year-old daughter, Fiona, often deals with customers, but she was about to give birth to her first child. Her twin brother, Marco, who used to make cash runs, was now focusing on school. So Castiglione was alone, his stress evident in the sweat on his forehead and the agitation on his face. When his business partner, who lives in Rosario, Argentina’s third-largest city, called to ask why he hadn’t taken care of one particularly insistent client, Castiglione erupted in frustration. “If you want it done faster, you pick up the phone and call her yourself,” he growled in Spanish, before switching to another call. After hanging up, he told me in English: “Everybody wants everything now, and I am just trying to do it. I’m not magical, as people think.” Magical, no, yet something new all the same. His occupation is one of the world’s oldest, but it remains a conspicuous part of modern life in Argentina: Calle Florida, one of the main streets in downtown Buenos Aires, is crowded day and night with men and women singing out “ cambio, cambio, cambio, casa de cambio ,” to serve local residents who want to trade volatile pesos for more stable and transportable currencies like the dollar. For Castiglione, however, money-changing means converting pesos and dollars into Bitcoin, a virtual currency, and vice versa. That afternoon, a plump 48-year-old musician was one of several customers to drop by the rented room. A German customer had paid the musician in Bitcoin for some freelance compositions, and the musician needed to turn them into dollars. Castiglione joked about the corruption of Argentine politics as he peeled off five $100 bills, which he was trading for a little more than 1.5 Bitcoins, and gave them to his client. The musician did not hand over anything in return; before showing up, he had transferred the Bitcoins — in essence, digital tokens that exist only as entries in a digital ledger — from his Bitcoin address to Castiglione’s. Had the German client instead sent euros to a bank in Argentina, the musician would have been required to fill out a form to receive payment and, as a result of the country’s currency controls, sacrificed roughly 30 percent of his earnings to change his euros into pesos. Bitcoin makes it easier to move money the other way too. The day before, the owner of a small manufacturing company bought $20,000 worth of Bitcoin from Castiglione in order to get his money to the United States, where he needed to pay a vendor, a transaction far easier and less expensive than moving funds through Argentine banks. Continue reading the main story The last client to visit the office that Friday was Alberto Vega, a stout 37-year-old in a neatly cut suit who heads the Argentine offices of the American Bitcoin company BitPay, whose technology enables merchants to accept Bitcoin payments. Like other BitPay employees — there is a staff of six in Buenos Aires — Vega receives his entire salary in Bitcoin and lives outside the traditional financial system. He orders what he can from websites that accept Bitcoin and goes to Castiglione when he needs cash. On this occasion, he needed 10,000 pesos to pay a roofer who was working on his house. Commerce of this sort has proved useful enough to Argentines that Castiglione has made a living buying and selling Bitcoin for the last year and a half. “We are trying to give a service,” he said. That mundane service — harnessing Bitcoin’s workaday utility — is what so excites some investors and entrepreneurs about Argentina. Banks everywhere hold money and move it around; they help make it possible for money to function as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. But thanks in large part to their country’s history of financial instability, a small yet growing number of Argentines are now using Bitcoin instead to fill those roles. They keep the currency in their Bitcoin “wallets,” digital accounts they access with a password, and use its network when they need to send or spend money, because even with Castiglione or one of his competitors serving as middlemen between the traditional economy and the Bitcoin marketplace, Bitcoin can be cheaper and more convenient than Argentina’s financial establishment. In effect, Argentines are conducting an ambitious experiment, one that threatens ultimately to spread to the United States and disrupt some of the most basic services its banks have to offer. Bitcoin first appeared in early 2009, introduced by a shadowy figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The software underlying its creation established that Bitcoins would be released slowly and steadily until there are 21 million of them; at that point, more than 12 decades from now, no more Bitcoins will be generated. These rules produced two somewhat predictable results, especially coming in the immediate wake of the financial crisis and the government bailouts of the big banks. The limited and regular release of Bitcoins appealed to libertarians, who have been skeptical of currencies that governments can print in unlimited quantities. (When Rand Paul announced his candidacy for president last month, his campaign’s website began accepting donations in Bitcoin.) The built-in sense of scarcity also led people to regard Bitcoin as a kind of digital gold, its value likely to increase over time — in other words, something to buy and sell as a speculative investment. The millions of traders, many of them in China, who have bet on the price of the virtual currency have kept the cumulative value of all outstanding Bitcoins well above $2 billion since late 2013. At the same time, that speculative activity has left much of the general public wondering why these virtual coins should be worth anything at all. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But the wild fluctuations in price — the value of a Bitcoin has bounced between $70 and $1,200 over the last two years — have obscured a significant aspect of the currency’s broader potential. Bitcoin digital tokens are part of a new kind of online financial network, which runs on the computers of those who use the virtual currency. People who join and support the network — hosting its open-source software, serving as record-keepers of sorts — receive new Bitcoins as they are released in a kind of recurring lottery, thus encouraging user participation. The details of how the network operates can be mind-numbingly complicated, involving lots of advanced math and cryptography, but at the most basic level, the network makes it possible for the first time to send valuable digital money around the world almost instantly, without moving through an intermediary like a bank or credit-card company or a service like PayPal. In a sense, the Bitcoin network was designed to be a financial version of email, which enables messages to be delivered without passing through a national postal service, or like the broader Internet itself, which allows people to publish news and essays without going through a media company. Instead of just delivering words, though, the Bitcoin network makes it possible to deliver money from New York to Shanghai in a matter of minutes without paying any financial institution. The number of Bitcoin users in Argentina is relatively small; it barely registers on most charts of global Bitcoin usage. But Argentina has been quietly gaining renown in technology circles as the first, and almost only, place where Bitcoins are being regularly used by ordinary people for real commercial transactions. A number of large American companies have started accepting Bitcoin payments, but so far there has been little economic incentive for their customers to pay with Bitcoins. Photo Dante Castiglione, left, at the Rock Hostel, with its owner, Soledad Rodriguez Pons, who accepts Bitcoin. Credit Mark Peterson/Redux, for The New York Times In contrast, the best-known Bitcoin start-up in Argentina, BitPagos, is helping more than 200 hotels, both cheap and boutique, take credit-card payments from foreign tourists. The money brought to Argentina using Bitcoin circumvents the onerous government restrictions on receiving money from abroad. Castiglione has some hotel clients, but he says that many of his 800 or so registered customers are freelancers who use Bitcoin to get paid by overseas clients, or companies that want to move money in and out of Argentina. A popular new online retailer, Avalancha, began accepting Bitcoin last summer and has seen the volume of Bitcoin transactions grow steadily since then. Avalancha offers customers a 10 percent discount when they use the virtual currency, because accepting credit cards generally ends up costing Avalancha more than 10 percent as a result of the vagaries of the Argentine financial system. The Bitcoin community in Buenos Aires has been vibrant enough to produce what’s known as the Bitcoin Embassy in the center of the city, a four-story building that serves as the home to eight start-ups whose businesses depends on the Bitcoin network. Continue reading the main story Bitcoin proponents like to say that the currency first became popular in the places that needed it least, like Europe and the United States, given how smoothly the currencies and financial services work there. It makes sense that a place like Argentina would be fertile ground for a virtual currency. Inflation is constant: At the end of 2014, for example, the peso was worth 25 percent less than it was at the beginning of the year. And that adversity pales in comparison with past bouts of hyperinflation, defaults on national debts and currency revaluations. Less than half of the population use Argentine banks and credit cards. Even wealthy Argentines fear keeping their money in the country’s banks. Wences Casares grew up on a remote sheep ranch in Patagonia and now lives on an estate looking out over Silicon Valley. He is, as much as anyone, responsible for making Bitcoin known in both Argentina and the United States. In 2001, he sold his first major start-up, a sort of ETrade for South Americans, to the Spanish bank Santander for $750 million. He sold his next big company, an online bank, to Banco Brasil. By the time he first heard about Bitcoin, in late 2011, he was in his first year of his latest start-up, Lemon, a mobile wallet for smartphones, not unlike Apple Pay, which came out three years later. His fascination with Bitcoin had less to do with professional experience, however, than a childhood spent in a country whose financial system seems to be terminally broken. There was rarely a time during Casares’s youth when Argentina was not enduring some sort of financial crisis. In 1983, after years of inflation, the government created the new peso: each new one was worth 10,000 old pesos. In 1985, the new peso, its value eroded by inflation, was in turn supplanted by the austral, worth 1,000 new pesos. Eventually the government went back to the peso, this time pegged to the dollar, an effort that also failed. “I think I understand economics better than most people because I grew up in Argentina,” Casares, now 41, told me. “I’ve seen every single monetary experiment you can imagine. This is the street-smart economics. Not the complex Ph.D. economics.” One particular episode is seared in Casares’s memory. In 1984, during the first significant episode of Argentine hyperinflation following the military junta’s loss of power, Casares’s mother came to get him and his two sisters from school one day. His mother carried two grocery bags filled with cash — the salary she had just been paid. She rushed with Casares and his sisters to the grocery store and made them run through the aisles, grabbing as much food as they could before the prices changed. (An employee walked through the store all day doing nothing but re-pricing the goods on the shelves to keep up with the rapidly changing value of the peso.) After paying at the register, Casares and his sisters ran back for more food to spend the leftover money on. In this hyperinflationary environment, holding on to pesos was the same thing as losing money. Continue reading the main story Casares is descended from one of Argentina’s old landholding families — a town called Carlos Casares, near Buenos Aires, is named after one of his ancestors — but his branch of the family went through hard times and ended up ranching sheep. When his father sold wool and the buyer’s check took a month to clear, that income could be halved by inflation, forcing yet more household cutbacks. Whatever savings accumulated were quickly exchanged for dollars, which held their value better than pesos. In 2003, Casares and five friends bought a school bus and drove it on a three-week road trip from Buenos Aires, the capital, to Tierra del Fuego, at the southern end of South America. After the vehicle was stolen upon their return, the friends vowed to buy a second bus for another trip. In December 2011, one of them, Jorge Restelli, finally found a bus for 60,000 pesos, or $14,000, in the classified ads. The friends who lived in Argentina quickly paid their shares to purchase and fix it up, but Casares stalled, knowing how much it cost in time and fees to move money from the United States to Argentina. Then Restelli told him that Bitcoin might be just the answer. At the time, the virtual currency had a small cult following in the United States and was essentially unheard-of in Argentina, but Restelli had read about it on an American tech blog. The same day Casares heard about Bitcoin, he found someone online who agreed to meet him at a cafe in Palo Alto and sell him 2,700 or so Bitcoins for about $8,000 in cash. Casares sent Restelli the Bitcoins that evening. Casares was fascinated by the transaction. Here was money that anyone could buy online and that promised to hold its value better than the peso. (That promise would later be tested by extreme price swings.) It also seemed to offer access to the financial system for those who couldn’t open bank accounts or secure credit cards. Even Casares, who created his first start-up in the country, had never held an Argentine bank account. He sent articles about Bitcoin to his bus-trip friends and explained how easy it was to move thousands of dollars in and out of Argentina. One friend went on to found the central Bitcoin advocacy group in Argentina and opened the Bitcoin Embassy in Buenos Aires. Casares began stockpiling Bitcoins, and when he visited Argentina during 2012, he posted offers to sell them on an Internet message board that was becoming a small, impromptu national marketplace for the virtual currency. He organized the first Bitcoin Meetup in Argentina in December 2012, though only a handful of people besides Restelli showed up at the whiskey bar where it was held. Photo Federico Murrone, left, and Wences Casares at Xapo, their company that handles Bitcoins, in Palo Alto, Calif. Credit Mark Peterson/Redux, for The New York Times By then, Casares was proclaiming Bitcoin’s promise to any Silicon Valley friend who would listen. He had come to believe that the advantages of its network would push the value of each Bitcoin to astronomical values, just as slivers of the airwave spectrum increased in worth as more communication companies sought to use it. In the meantime, each Bitcoin could serve as an easy, secure place to store money, comparable to gold. Continue reading the main story Many of Casares’s friends in the United States were initially skeptical: What could Bitcoin do that their credit cards couldn’t? But Casares explained how places like Argentina were different. His first big convert among his friends, and the one whose opinion in this area mattered the most, was David Marcus, who had recently become the president of PayPal. Marcus’s light-bulb moment came in the fall of 2012, when the Argentine government ordered PayPal to bar direct payments between Argentines, part of the government’s effort to slow the exchange of pesos into other currencies. As the policy went into effect, and Marcus watched the price of Bitcoin rise against the peso, he figured that Argentines were using Bitcoin to circumvent the government’s restrictions. Marcus began buying Bitcoins himself and also pushed PayPal to start investigating the currency’s use. In March 2013 Casares attended an exclusive technology conference near Tucson hosted by the investment bank Allen & Company. At dinner the first night, Casares won the attention of a table full of investors by describing his childhood experiences in Argentina and how Bitcoin equipped people to avoid similar situations. He demonstrated the capabilities of the Bitcoin network by sending $250,000 worth of the virtual currency to the phone of a table mate, who was then directed to pass the money along to the man next to him with no more than a few taps of his iPhone keypad. During the next two days of the conference, a steady stream of attendees who had seen or heard about the Sunday-evening conversation approached Casares, including Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn. On a hike Wednesday afternoon, Casares spent the entire time explaining the concept to Charlie Songhurst, Microsoft’s head of corporate strategy. At the time, Casares was still running his mobile-wallet start-up and had no business stake connected to Bitcoin beyond his own holdings of the virtual currency, which had become substantial. He urged his friends to make their own purchases. On Monday, the first full day of the conference, the price of a Bitcoin jumped more than $2, to $36, and on Tuesday it rose more than $4, its sharpest rise in months, to more than $40. After everyone flew home from the conference, Songhurst wrote a paper and distributed it privately to some of the most powerful investors in Silicon Valley. “We foresee a real possibility that all currencies go digital, and competition eliminates all currencies from noneffective governments,” it said, channeling Casares’s arguments. “The power of friction-free transactions over the Internet will unleash the typical forces of consolidation and globalization, and we will end up with six digital currencies: US Dollar, euro, Yen, Pound, Renminbi and Bitcoin.” The buzz generated by the conference was not the only factor that pushed up the price of Bitcoin in March 2013. A financial crisis in Cyprus came to a head in the middle of the month; the closure of some bank accounts there led to conjecture that Russians were seeking refuge from the Cypriot banking system in Bitcoin. But Casares noticed that every time he helped another one of his wealthy friends start buying Bitcoins, prices rose, suggesting to him that they were responsible for much of the increase. Over the course of March, the price of a single Bitcoin nearly tripled, to around $100, and that surge generated the first widespread media coverage in the United States and Argentina (some of it, not coincidentally, from journalists cultivated by Casares). The crowd at the next Bitcoin Meetup in Argentina, hosted in April by one of Casares’s friends, was about five times larger than the first one organized by Casares just a few months earlier. Continue reading the main story Dante Castiglione first heard about Bitcoin that same March. A Canadian who hired him to do some software consulting asked if he could pay him in Bitcoin. Castiglione, who grew up in a small apartment in downtown Buenos Aires, ran his own consulting firm, the latest in a long line of jobs after he dropped out of college. He is a successful version of what Argentines refer to as a buscavida , a person who gets by finding opportunities on the fringes of society, a more expansive career option in Argentina than in most countries. When it came to working for overseas clients, the biggest issue for Castiglione, like many Argentines, was the government-set exchange rate between dollars and pesos. In an attempt to tamp down inflation, the government has long forced banks to sell dollars at artificially low rates. In March 2013, the government said a dollar was worth around 5 pesos. But anyone could go to one of the money changers on Calle Florida and trade a dollar bill for about 8 pesos, the black-market rate, also known as the dólar blue . (Economists and people outside Argentina often regard the dólar blue as the real exchange rate, a closer reflection of the peso’s actual worth.) The official exchange rate was costly for businessmen like Castiglione. When dollars from foreign customers came in through traditional means, banks automatically converted them at the mandated rate, and Castiglione ended up with three fewer pesos for each dollar than he would have gotten by exchanging them on the street. Castiglione had to sacrifice nearly 40 percent of a foreign payment to turn it into pesos. When the Canadian customer paid Castiglione in Bitcoins, Castiglione found someone online willing to meet him in Buenos Aires and pay him in pesos at something close to the dólar blue rate. The demand for his Bitcoins was, in fact, so great that Castiglione, whose company was limping along, began to think there might be a business opportunity there. If he bought Bitcoins for slightly less than he sold them, he could make a profit on every trade, even if the price of Bitcoin didn’t go up. By September 2013, he had become a full-time Bitcoin broker. In-person Bitcoin trading, as Castiglione does it, happens in many other cities around the world. But if this were the only way to procure Bitcoins, the interest in trading them would not have exploded as it has in the United States and China, where exchanging money directly with strangers — without a trusted middleman, in other words — is not a routine part of business. In most places where Bitcoin has become popular, there have been ways to buy the virtual currency online. This, of course, requires cooperation with banks or other payment networks, which happened in the United States and Europe. The American company Coinbase, for instance, allows customers to transfer money from their bank to a Coinbase account and buy Bitcoins online. In Argentina, the banks refuse to work with Bitcoin companies like Coinbase, which isn’t surprising, given the government’s tight control over banks. This hasn’t deterred Argentines, long accustomed to changing money outside official channels. For Castiglione and his company, DigiCoins, this means operating at the edge of the law, but he takes comfort from the fact that, at least for now, the Argentine government has bigger problems to deal with. Continue reading the main story Instead of bank tellers and branches, Bitcoin users in Argentina have come to rely on Castiglione and his competitors, some of whom are even willing to make house calls. This financial system developed much more slowly than it has in the United States, where American companies could take deposits from banks anywhere in the country. But as a result, Argentina’s Bitcoin economy is much more resistant to bank policies, government regulations and full-service companies like Coinbase that undermine Bitcoin’s decentralizing spirit. Continue reading the main story I first met Castiglione when I visited Buenos Aires in June 2014. At the time, he was working downtown, out of a stuffy single room in the same building as a Berlitz language-school office. A joker playing card was lodged in the corner of the whiteboard on the wall. A friend of Castiglione’s son was at a desk, working on the DigiCoins website. His daughter, Fiona, was in touch with customers by phone and online. His son, Marco, was in and out, taking cash to clients, which he carried in his backpack. Sitting behind his own desk next to the door, Castiglione was describing the life of a money-changer, especially when it comes to matters of security. He spoke with tough confidence: “Not many people will like to mess with us.” But he acknowledged that he and his children remained safe largely because they successfully kept their clients ignorant of their location by switching offices frequently: “Right now, maybe God is on our side.” One of Castiglione’s main competitors was another Bitcoin broker named Brenda Fernández. Originally from the Buenos Aires suburbs and a college dropout, she previously smuggled electronics into the country and sold them on the local equivalent of eBay. She talked in loud bursts, punctuated with high-pitched laughs, and proudly made provocative statements about breaking the law and ignoring standard business practices when I met her at an event at the Bitcoin Embassy. “I find a way to market myself as the crazy Bitcoin girl,” she told me. In a more serious moment, Fernández, who is 24, attributed both her attitude and her embrace of Bitcoin in part to the gender transition she made in her early 20s, after years of struggling with traditional gender categories. “It feels good, doing things that you are not supposed to, saying to the structures of power that they don’t have power over you,” she said. After the event at the embassy, Fernández took a small black-and-yellow taxi to a hostel near the National Congress that wanted to exchange about $1,000 worth of Bitcoins. The Rock Hostel, with band-themed rooms, caters to a young clientele. A number of people were drinking beer in the common area when Fernández showed up. The owner, a tattooed 29-year-old named Soledad Rodriguez Pons, had already transferred the Bitcoins to Fernández online, so after a bit of flirting, Fernández quickly handed over the cash; the transaction took place at the reception desk, where a sign offered customers a 10 percent discount if they paid by credit card. On top of the desk, under glass, were paper currencies from around the world. Continue reading the main story The Rock Hostel is one of hundreds of hotels in the country using the Argentine start-up BitPagos to collect credit-card payments from foreign customers. If Rodriguez Pons accepted credit-card payments from American customers through the usual financial channels, customers would be billed in dollars, and when those dollars came to Rodriguez Pons’s Argentine bank account, they would be converted at the official rate, about 30 percent lower than the black-market rate. It would also take 20 days for Rodriguez Pons to get her pesos. BitPagos helped counter these drawbacks by taking the credit-card payment in the United States and then using the dollars to buy Bitcoins, generally from Coinbase, before sending them to Rodriguez Pons immediately. When Rodriguez Pons needed to pay the rent or laundry bills, she called Fernández or Castiglione — her two standbys — to sell the Bitcoins for pesos at a rate close to the dólar blue . Rodriguez Pons saved so much money this way that she could offer the 10 percent discount for credit cards and still easily come out ahead. In June 2014, BitPagos moved about $150,000 for the Rock Hostel and other tourist establishments, nearly twice what it handled three months earlier. Rodriguez Pons, like many BitPagos clients, knew little about how Bitcoin worked and hadn’t tried hard to figure it out. She once, somewhat accidentally, held onto her Bitcoins at a time when the price was rising, and ended up with a small windfall when she sold. She used the proceeds to build a rooftop bar and a music-rehearsal space. Beyond those extras, Rodriguez Pons credited the savings from using BitPagos with keeping her business alive in Argentina’s very difficult business environment. The hardest part was often reaching Fernández and Castiglione. “I had to call Brenda four times today,” she said with a smile. As anyone who has dealt with Western Union or wired money abroad already knows, Argentina is not the only place that could benefit from Bitcoin’s easier and cheaper way of moving money across international borders. A Hong Kong firm called Bitspark recently opened a shop in a mall popular with Filipino domestic workers, through which they can send money back home using Bitcoin. Another firm, BitPesa, allows customers to convert Bitcoins into Kenyan shillings and deliver them into mobile wallets within Kenya. Transactions of this sort inevitably stir up fears of money laundering and terrorist financing. Banks currently serve as the front line in stopping illicit money transfers. If these regulated institutions are cut out of the business of moving money, the banks and government officials say, who will ensure that terrorists and organized crime are not using the network to move millions across borders? The fact that there is no single authority responsible for supervising the Bitcoin system has also made it easier for con men and thieves to defraud companies holding Bitcoins for customers — something that became clear last year when Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, declared bankruptcy after nearly half a billion dollars of clients’ Bitcoins were fraudulently transferred out of their accounts. (A hacker generally needs only an owner’s password to steal his or her Bitcoins.) Continue reading the main story Oddly enough, American regulators have actually been friendlier than banks toward the new technology. Even before the advent of Bitcoin, the Federal Reserve was looking into ways to update the relatively antiquated American payment networks, which often take two or three days to complete a simple money transfer. Several different branches of the Federal Reserve have released research papers over the last few years praising the improvements that Bitcoin might spur, even if Bitcoin itself isn’t adopted by the mainstream as a virtual currency. In 2013, when he was chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke wrote a letter to a Senate committee studying Bitcoin in which he praised its “long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.” Photo The Bitcoin broker Brenda Fernandez scans the QR code of her client's virtual wallet to make a trade. Credit Mark Peterson/Redux, for The New York Times Banks are aware that this is an area in which they will likely have to adapt or lose business, perhaps even be made irrelevant. While most of the major banks have criticized Bitcoin and refused to work with virtual-currency companies, many of them are nonetheless spending a lot of time and energy behind the scenes studying the technology. JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank, decided in early 2014 not to conduct business with Bitcoin companies. But it did form its own Bitcoin Working Group, which consists of about two dozen executives throughout the bank who have been meeting fortnightly or monthly to discuss how the technology could change their business. Banks are captivated, in particular, by the ledger on which all Bitcoins and Bitcoin transactions are recorded: what is known as the blockchain. Unlike traditional financial ledgers, kept by a central institution, the Bitcoin ledger is updated and maintained by everyone on the network, not unlike how Wikipedia is written and monitored by its users. One virtue of this approach is that the network has no central point subject to failure, like Visa and the New York Stock Exchange in their financial realms. It also means there is no middleman collecting fees with each transaction. And because the bookkeeping is publicly accessible, records can’t be manipulated in secret or after the fact. JPMorgan belongs to an association of big banks, the Clearing House, that has been confidentially putting together a “proof of concept” for a decentralized ledger, or blockchain, that would run on the computers of all the participating banks. According to people involved, this network, which is still in the conceptual phase, could allow instant transfers between accounts at all the member banks and eliminate the current risks involved in having billions of dollars in limbo for days at a time. For many bankers, the most valuable potential use of the blockchain is not small payments but very large ones, which account for the vast majority of the money moving around the world each day. The banks, though, are moving slowly, even as several start-ups are trying to use the Bitcoin blockchain to do the same thing on a global basis, cutting out the banks altogether. Continue reading the main story One of the most recent entrants into this area is a start-up led by a former top executive from JPMorgan. The Federal Reserve has had its own people looking at how to utilize the blockchain technology and potentially even Bitcoin itself. If someone can find a way to minimize the volatility of Bitcoin prices — as many are trying to do — it would be much easier for people to keep their savings in Bitcoin instead of a bank account. “In the long run, Bitcoin will be very disruptive to the developed world,” Dan Morehead, a former Goldman Sachs executive who now runs a hedge fund focused on Bitcoin, told me. Things are happening sooner in Argentina, he said, because its financial system creates hassles for the people there. But, he added, “Argentina is just a more extreme example of the situation in every country.” When I returned to Argentina in February this year, the price of Bitcoin had been falling for some time, scaring off many speculators in the United States. There was no sign of waning interest in Argentina, however. Several new companies were trying to provide a more seamless and reliable version of Castiglione’s service. BitPagos had recently started a service allowing its users to buy and sell small quantities of Bitcoin online and was closing in on a million-dollar fund-raising round with Silicon Valley venture capitalists, including Dan Morehead’s firm. A new company, Bitex, which had its own office down the street from the Bitcoin Embassy, was focused on using Bitcoin to transfer money among Latin American countries. All of the Argentine Bitcoin companies were working on expanding into Venezuela, where inflation is an even greater problem. Castiglione was so busy running around the city, trying to keep up with the competition, that he was hard to pin down. When we finally met near the Bitcoin Embassy, late at night, he was with a tough-looking friend who was joining DigiCoins to help with the physical deliveries of cash, bringing with him a motorcycle and experience handling large amounts of money. The men had just come back from a trip to a town three hours west of Buenos Aires, where they had sold $20,000 worth of Bitcoins. They had been forced to make the trip at the last minute because another big sale had fallen through, and they did not otherwise have enough dollars to conduct business for the next few days. “If I hadn’t gotten that cash, I was done,” Castiglione told me, before heading out for a last trade just before midnight. Earlier that day, as I sat with Fernández in a Subway sandwich shop, which was her temporary office, chosen for its free Wi-Fi, she did not try to hide her difficulty in adapting to the more competitive environment with her “crazy Bitcoin girl” routine, which was making it hard to keep big customers. She did have one business in the United States that sent her about $5,000 worth of Bitcoins each month and had her exchange the money and deposit the pesos into the company’s Argentine bank account, in order to make payroll. But a lot of her customers were young people who wanted to buy a few hundred pesos worth of a Bitcoin so that they could pay online for a Netflix subscription or a video game. “The market moved in another direction,” she said, “and I didn’t move in that direction.” Continue reading the main story She had come to have serious doubts about whether Bitcoin would end up being any better than the old system if it was dominated by the ruling class, which would be immune to any popular backlash, thanks to the lack of a central Bitcoin authority. “The key turning point is when the rich elite see it as a way to safeguard their wealth,” she said. Among the people Fernández and Castiglione were both contending with was Wences Casares. He decided in late 2013 that he cared too much about Bitcoin to leave its development to others. He quickly sold his digital-wallet start-up and started his own Bitcoin-centric company with one of the friends from the bus trip, Federico Murrone, an Argentine who was the head programmer on Casares’s past start-ups. Within two months of selling their old company, Casares and Murrone had secured $40 million in funding from investors like Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder. The office that Casares’s new company, Xapo (pronounced “zappo”), opened in Buenos Aires has none of the scrappiness of other virtual-currency players in the country. It occupies a full floor of a building in a fashionable part of the city; amenities included table tennis, glass walls and large, wall-mounted televisions. Xapo initially concentrated on ultrasecure storage for customers who own lots of Bitcoins — it holds the Bitcoins of many of the wealthy tech moguls who followed Casares’s advice. But Casares has ambitions to turn the company into a one-stop financial provider for the virtual-currency industry. The global aspirations were evident from the Hindi-language site that I saw his staff creating. Casares spent months establishing a partnership with Taringa, the most popular Argentine social network. This month, millions of Taringa members in Argentina and the rest of Latin America automatically had a Xapo Bitcoin wallet opened for them. Users will be able to put Bitcoins or fractions of Bitcoins in their wallets by depositing cash at local drugstores, in the same way they pay utility bills. From those accounts, Argentines can pay for things online without a credit card or make online micropayments of 5 or 10 cents for video games and other digital goods (credit cards usually charge a minimum of 25 or 30 cents for each purchase). When I asked Castiglione what he thought about a global venture like Xapo, he evinced a workingman’s skepticism. “We might not be as big as Wences, but the real thing happens here,” Castiglione said, as we sat in his temporary office between client visits. “People get the cash to spend.” Whether his endeavors would help Bitcoin live up to its grand promise — supplanting Wall Street and central banks — was something Castiglione would consider only in the most pragmatic terms. “If people don’t use it, it will go to trash, like anything that isn’t used in this world,” he told me. “If people use it, then it has a future.” \nNathaniel Popper is a financial reporter for The New York Times. \nThis article was adapted from “Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money,” to be published in May by Harper, a division of HarperCollins. \nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of The New York Times Magazine delivered to your inbox every week.

      "text": "A Narrow Escape A Narrow Escape A social activist helps win a pardon for a condemned killer, who tries to use his second chance to rebuild his life. Publish Date April 28, 2015. Continue reading the main story In the second of two episodes examining the criminal justice system in Iran , Thomas Erdbrink discusses the power of forgiveness with Sharmin Meymandinejad, a social activist, and Safar Angouti, the condemned killer Mr. Meymandinejad helped save from execution. Mr. Meymandinejad answered selected readers’ questions. “I must say that my answers to the following questions are all from the point of view of a social activist who believes his responsibility is to help the people and must avoid any step that might mislead him from his main goal,” he said. Q. and A. To what degree did your Muslim faith play a role in your decision to ask for Angouti’s pardon? — Mitchell Glixon, New York, N.Y., and Mitchglixon247 on Instagram This is a complicated issue and one who participates in similar activities might have a combination of different religious, humanitarian, social, and personal motivations. This is how it works for me. What makes me happy now is the fact that Safar is alive. He is alive and breathing somewhere trying to make a life for himself. Since we met Thomas Erdbrink to talk about Safar’s story, my organization has succeeded in saving eight or nine more people from the gallows. If forgiveness from the family of the victim is all that is required to spare the perpetrator from the gallows, how will justice be served to protect the moral integrity of the society? — Jonathan Mom, Singapore, and @thejonegg on Twitter . I cannot explain anything about these laws; I did not write them. It is for the lawyers to comment on. As a social activist, I just try to do my best under the current conditions. Would you prefer that forgiven murderers are set free, as they are now, or are simply given a life sentence in jail rather than a death sentence? — Jason Feifer, Brooklyn, N.Y., and @heyfeifer on Twitter. Based on the current law, everything rests with the victim’s family. I really do not know what justice can be if we want to replace it with anything else. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to answer this question. Episodes: Our Man in Tehran View More APRIL 21, 2015 This sounds a lot like paying/bribing your way out of punishment. Poor victims are easier to buy off while wealthy criminals can afford to pay. How is this not a corruption of justice? P.S. We have the same in America, but it is obscured by “justice.” — Kevin Oeters, New York, N.Y. Yes, I agree. Based on my experience, I have seen that poor families sitting at the negotiating table become more flexible when the discussion comes to money. As time passes from the day that they have lost their loved ones, the victim’s family start to think that they can get some money. But those families with lots of money usually do not let us in the front door. It is too difficult to start talking with them about forgiveness and to negotiate with them. I accept that this is an inconvenience, but for now we should deal with it. I understand the desire to forgive by the victim’s family. But doesn’t the state have any interest in punishment or protecting the wider community from the perpetrator? What is the average time from trial until conviction? — Rebecca Gaudet, Coronado, Calif. Continue reading the main story All I can say is that this is the general outcome of the society, and for now it is working to some extent. It is the society that makes decisions for itself. About the statistic of the convictions and the average time interval, I really have no idea. I am not dealing with judiciary statistics. What changes would Mr. Meymandinejad like to see made to the Iranian criminal justice system, if any? Does he generally approve of the eye-for-an-eye system? What are his thoughts on other criminal justice systems — what does he admire/disapprove of and why? — Jessica Gonzales, Brooklyn, N.Y. Answering all parts of this question together, I think that one can conclude based on my work and the work of my organization where we stand on the issues and how we think about them. If I want to change anything about the law, I will use the available Islamic rules, like paying so-called blood money, which is based on the law of blood for blood, which is not so strict. I am not a lawyer though. Character Dossier: Sharmin Meymandinejad Date of birth: March 31, 1963 Hometown: Tehran Education: B.A. in dramatic arts and M.A. in dramatic literature from the University of Tehran. Employment: Theater director, playwright and founder of the Society of Students Against Poverty — the Imam Ali Society. Life experiences: I have written and directed plays and scripts for national television. I have also taught acting courses at the University of Tehran’s college of fine arts, and theater-therapy classes at Alzahra University. In 1999 I founded the first nonpartisan, student N.G.O. in Iran. The organization aims to resolve social problems, especially threats to children like child labor and children’s addiction. How do you describe yourself? I find myself to be too sensitive. I would like it if I were a bit more indifferent to what was happening around me. Are you active on the Internet? The Imam Ali Society has a website. I just have a Facebook page to be connected to friends. What do you hope for the future? As long as I have plans, I think that I can manage the future. What are your hobbies? I like writing and playing computer games. The more stupid the game is, the better. I need these games to distract me from the hell this world can be. Have you ever traveled outside Iran? Where? What did you think? I have traveled to the United Arab Emirates, the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Iraq. I found Iraq to be very similar to Iran. The U.A.E., I will never go back, not even for a visit. I did not like it at all. I think I could live in a place like Saudi Arabia. But I cannot live in a country like America because the people do not seem very interested in solving other people’s problems, and everyone was just busy trying to make money and upgrade their car to a newer model. What is your most important memory? I raised an orphan girl for about 10 years, since 2004. Around her 18th birthday, in 2010, we found out that she had been raped as a child. I learned that she wanted to commit suicide. She wanted to jump from a mountain, so I went to the mountain with her. I told her that if she jumped I would jump, too. She did not. Continue reading the main story Together, we have established now 30 houses in poor neighborhoods for vulnerable children like she was. This girl, now 22, has a son of her own named Sharmin. What do you love most? My wife. I love her. Without her, I would be just a crazy man with thousands of irrelevant ideas and dreams. She took me seriously. She took my dreams seriously. Why is forgiveness important? Forgiveness is the light in which all the beauties of the world can be seen. No one can justify forgiveness with worldly reasons. It is a spiritual power that leads one from difficulties to a better place. Character Dossier: Safar Angouti Date of birth : Sept. 19, 1989 Hometown : Karaj, Iran, northwest of Tehran Education : I left school after my junior year of high school. Employment : Construction worker. Life experiences: The greatest event of my life was my release from prison and receiving a pardon before I was to be executed. How do you describe yourself? I love working. I love my family. I feel I am in debt to all the people who helped win my release. Are you active on the Internet? No, I am not. I have access to the Internet, but I do not use it. What do you hope for the future? We hold our future in our own hands. We can build it; otherwise everything will be the same. Nothing changes until we change it ourselves. What are your hobbies? After work, I say my prayers and sit beside the window. I try calling my girlfriend and sending her messages, but she does not answer me. This is all I do these days. Have you ever traveled outside Iran? Where? What did you think? I have never left Iran. What is your most important memory? My best memory is from the day that my girlfriend, her mother and I went to a holy shrine together. Our love was divine, and everything was great. But I have not seen her since that day. She stopped seeing me and stopped answering my phone calls. What do you love most? I love my family. What is injustice? Injustice is to steal people’s property and money; to be cruel to the people. I do not think that what happened to me was injustice. At first it was very difficult. I had tough days. But I found God in prison. I had enough time to think about everything there. Why is forgiveness important? Forgiveness leads to forgiveness. If I forgive the people who have not been fair to me today, then there will be another day when someone forgives me for something bad that I have done. \nFollow Thomas Erdbrink on Facebook and Twitter @ThomasErdbrink , and for new episodes of “Our Man in Tehran,” you can like The New York Times on Facebook and follow @nytimesworld on Twitter.

      "text": "Political News, Now. Now, she said, she plans on concentrating on getting information out publicly, rather than continuing what she sees as a futile attempt to take action against major violations. She said she was resigned to the fact that “there is not going to be any real enforcement” in the coming election. “The few rules that are left, people feel free to ignore,” said Ellen L. Weintraub, a Democratic commissioner. Republican members of the commission see no such crisis. They say they are comfortable with how things are working under the structure that gives each party three votes. No action at all, they say, is better than overly aggressive steps that could chill political speech. “Congress set this place up to gridlock,” Lee E. Goodman, a Republican commissioner, said in an interview. “This agency is functioning as Congress intended. The democracy isn’t collapsing around us.” Continue reading the main story Experts predict that the 2016 race could produce a record fund-raising haul of as much as $10 billion, with the growth fueled by well-financed outside groups. On their own, the conservative billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch have promised to spend $889 million through their political network. With the rise of the super PACs and the loosening of legal restrictions on corporate spending, campaigns and groups are turning to creative new methods of raising money. Writing in March in The Washington Post , Ms. Ravel charged that some candidates — she did not name names — appeared to have been amassing large war chests at fund-raisers this year without acknowledging that they were at least considering a presidential run, which would trigger campaign finance limits and disclosure. She said it was “absurd” to think that such politicians were not at least considering a White House run under federal law. “It’s the Wild West out there in some ways,” said Kate A. Belinski, a former lawyer at the commission who now works on campaign finance at a law firm. Candidates and political groups are increasingly willing to push the limits, she said, and the F.E.C.’s inaction means that “there’s very little threat of getting caught.” Some disputes between the commissioners have gotten personal. A disagreement over how to treat online political ads, for instance, turned tense when Ms. Ravel received anonymous online threats over charges that she was trying to “regulate” the Internet. She angrily confronted Mr. Goodman, charging that he had unfairly “fanned the flames” against her by mischaracterizing her position in an interview he did on Fox News. But Mr. Goodman said he had no regrets about challenging her position, which he saw as opening the door to greater regulation of Internet activities. Relations between the two have been difficult ever since. Last fall, Ms. Ravel did join Republicans on the commission — and took some criticism from the left — in a 4-to-2 decision that eased rules growing out of the Citizens United decision and a related case. But she has had little success in persuading Republicans to vote with her on enforcement measures. She said she was particularly frustrated that Republican commissioners would not support cases against four nonprofit groups — including Crossroads GPS, founded by Karl Rove — accused of improperly using their tax-exempt status for massive and well-financed political campaigns. A surge in this so-called “dark money” in politics — hundreds of millions of dollars raised by nonprofits, trade associations and other groups that can keep their donations secrets — has alarmed campaign-finance reformers who are pushing to make such funding public. But Mr. Goodman said the problem was exaggerated. He and other Republicans defend their decisions to block many investigations, saying Democrats have pushed cases beyond what the law allows. “We’re not interested in going after people unless the law is fairly clear, and we’re not willing to take the law beyond where it’s written,” said Caroline C. Hunter, a Republican commissioner. Democrats view the law “more broadly,” she said. Continue reading the main story The commission has not always been so hamstrung. In 2006, it unanimously imposed major fines against high-profile groups — liberal and conservative — for breaking campaign finance laws two years earlier by misusing their tax-exempt status for political fund-raising and campaigning. The penalties put political groups on notice, and experts credited them with helping curb similar abuses in the 2008 campaign. These days, the six commissioners hardly ever rule unanimously on major cases, or even on some of the most minor matters. Last month at an event commemorating the commission’s 40th anniversary, even the ceremony proved controversial. Democrats and Republicans skirmished over where to hold it, whom to include and even whether to serve bagels or doughnuts. In a rare compromise, they ended up serving both. Standing in front of a montage of photos from the F.E.C.’s history, Ms. Ravel told staff members and guests that there was a “crisis” in public confidence, and she stressed the F.E.C’s mandate for “enforcing the law.” But the ranking Republican, Matthew S. Petersen, made no mention of enforcement in his remarks a few minutes later, focusing instead on defending political speech under the First Amendment. As guests mingled, Ms. Weintraub — the commission’s longest-serving member at 12 years — lamented to a reporter that the days when the panel could work together on important issues were essentially over. She pointed to a former Republican commissioner standing nearby — Bradley A. Smith, who left the agency in 2005 — and said she used to be able to work with commissioners like him even when they disagreed on ideology. Laughing, Mr. Smith assumed a fighting stance and yelled at Ms. Weintraub: “Let’s go right now, you speech-hating enemy of the First Amendment!” A few feet away, Mr. Goodman was not laughing. As Ms. Weintraub condemned the F.E.C.’s inertia, he whispered a point-by-point rebuttal to show that things were not as bad as she made them sound. With the commission so often deadlocked, the major fines assessed by the commission dropped precipitously last year to $135,813 from $627,408 in 2013. But like most things at the F.E.C., commissioners differ over how to interpret those numbers. Republicans say they believe the commission’s efforts to work with political groups on training and compliance have kept campaigns within the legal lines and helped to bring down fines. The drop in fines “could easily be read as a signal that people are following the law,” said Ms. Hunter, the Republican commissioner. Ms. Ravel scoffed at that explanation. “What’s really going on,” she said, “is that the Republican commissioners don’t want to enforce the law, except in the most obvious cases. The rules aren’t being followed, and that’s destructive to the political process.” \nFollow The New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .

In 2006, it unanimously imposed major fines against high-profile groups — liberal and conservative — for breaking campaign finance laws two years earlier by misusing their tax-exempt status for political fund-raising and campaigning. The penalties put political groups on notice, and experts credited them with helping curb similar abuses in the 2008 campaign. These days, the six commissioners hardly ever rule unanimously on major cases, or even on some of the most minor matters. Last month at an event commemorating the commission’s 40th anniversary, even the ceremony proved controversial. Democrats and Republicans skirmished over where to hold it, whom to include and even whether to serve bagels or doughnuts. In a rare compromise, they ended up serving both. Standing in front of a montage of photos from the F.E.C.’s history, Ms. Ravel told staff members and guests that there was a “crisis” in public confidence, and she stressed the F.E.C’s mandate for “enforcing the law.” But the ranking Republican, Matthew S. Petersen, made no mention of enforcement in his remarks a few minutes later, focusing instead on defending political speech under the First Amendment. As guests mingled, Ms. Weintraub — the commission’s longest-serving member at 12 years — lamented to a reporter that the days when the panel could work together on important issues were essentially over. She pointed to a former Republican commissioner standing nearby — Bradley A. Smith, who left the agency in 2005 — and said she used to be able to work with commissioners like him even when they disagreed on ideology. Laughing, Mr. Smith assumed a fighting stance and yelled at Ms. Weintraub: “Let’s go right now, you speech-hating enemy of the First Amendment!” A few feet away, Mr. Goodman was not laughing. As Ms. Weintraub condemned the F.E.C.’s inertia, he whispered a point-by-point rebuttal to show that things were not as bad as she made them sound. With the commission so often deadlocked, the major fines assessed by the commission dropped precipitously last year to $135,813 from $627,408 in 2013. But like most things at the F.E.C., commissioners differ over how to interpret those numbers. Republicans say they believe the commission’s efforts to work with political groups on training and compliance have kept campaigns within the legal lines and helped to bring down fines. The drop in fines “could easily be read as a signal that people are following the law,” said Ms. Hunter, the Republican commissioner. Ms. Ravel scoffed at that explanation. “What’s really going on,” she said, “is that the Republican commissioners don’t want to enforce the law, except in the most obvious cases. The rules aren’t being followed, and that’s destructive to the political process.” \nFollow The New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .

      "text": "Political News, Now. Now, she said, she plans on concentrating on getting information out publicly, rather than continuing what she sees as a futile attempt to take action against major violations. She said she was resigned to the fact that “there is not going to be any real enforcement” in the coming election. “The few rules that are left, people feel free to ignore,” said Ellen L. Weintraub, a Democratic commissioner. Republican members of the commission see no such crisis. They say they are comfortable with how things are working under the structure that gives each party three votes. No action at all, they say, is better than overly aggressive steps that could chill political speech. “Congress set this place up to gridlock,” Lee E. Goodman, a Republican commissioner, said in an interview. “This agency is functioning as Congress intended. The democracy isn’t collapsing around us.” Continue reading the main story Experts predict that the 2016 race could produce a record fund-raising haul of as much as $10 billion, with the growth fueled by well-financed outside groups. On their own, the conservative billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch have promised to spend $889 million through their political network. With the rise of the super PACs and the loosening of legal restrictions on corporate spending, campaigns and groups are turning to creative new methods of raising money. Writing in March in The Washington Post , Ms. Ravel charged that some candidates — she did not name names — appeared to have been amassing large war chests at fund-raisers this year without acknowledging that they were at least considering a presidential run, which would trigger campaign finance limits and disclosure. She said it was “absurd” to think that such politicians were not at least considering a White House run under federal law. “It’s the Wild West out there in some ways,” said Kate A. Belinski, a former lawyer at the commission who now works on campaign finance at a law firm. Candidates and political groups are increasingly willing to push the limits, she said, and the F.E.C.’s inaction means that “there’s very little threat of getting caught.” As a lawyer in Silicon Valley who went after ethics violators in California during her time there, Ms. Ravel brought to Washington both a reformer’s mentality and a tech-savvy background, and she has used Twitter and other media to try to attract young people and women to politics. But her aggressive efforts have angered some Republicans, who charged that an F.E.C. hearing she scheduled for next week on challenges facing women in politics was not only outside the commission’s jurisdiction but a thinly veiled attempt to help the presidential bid of Hillary Rodham Clinton. Ms. Ravel called the accusations “crazy.” Some disputes between the commissioners have gotten personal. A disagreement over how to treat online political ads, for instance, turned tense when Ms. Ravel received anonymous online threats over charges that she was trying to “regulate” the Internet. She angrily confronted Mr. Goodman, charging that he had unfairly “fanned the flames” against her by mischaracterizing her position in an interview he did on Fox News. But Mr. Goodman said he had no regrets about challenging her position, which he saw as opening the door to greater regulation of Internet activities. Relations between the two have been difficult ever since. Last fall, Ms. Ravel did join Republicans on the commission — and took some criticism from the left — in a 4-to-2 decision that eased rules growing out of the Citizens United decision and a related case. But she has had little success in persuading Republicans to vote with her on enforcement measures. She said she was particularly frustrated that Republican commissioners would not support cases against four nonprofit groups — including Crossroads GPS, founded by Karl Rove — accused of improperly using their tax-exempt status for massive and well-financed political campaigns. Continue reading the main story A surge in this so-called “dark money” in politics — hundreds of millions of dollars raised by nonprofits, trade associations and other groups that can keep their donations secret — has alarmed campaign-finance reformers who are pushing to make such funding public. But Mr. Goodman said the problem was exaggerated. He and other Republicans defend their decisions to block many investigations, saying Democrats have pushed cases beyond what the law allows. “We’re not interested in going after people unless the law is fairly clear, and we’re not willing to take the law beyond where it’s written,” said Caroline C.

      "text": "  ■ Trade unions should be bolstered to represent workers’ interests. ■ Government should provide public-sector jobs at minimum wage to those who want them, in areas such as meals-on-wheels, elderly care, child care and so on. ■ In addition to a minimum wage, there should be a framework to restrain pay at the highest levels. Atkinson cites companies that have voluntarily decreed that executive pay should be capped at 65 or 75 times the average pay in the firm. ■ Personal income taxes should be made more progressive, with a maximum rate of 65 percent. ■ Every child should get a “child benefit” payment, to help keep kids out of poverty. So if we’re all upset at inequality, these are ideas to debate. Others, including Stiglitz, have put forth many more. Research groups like MDRC have rigorous evidence of what breaks cycles of poverty. In short: We’re not helpless. In the case of inequality, there’s a bizarre disconnect between the scale of the challenge and the tools politicians are prepared to use. This is, according to a Pew survey last year , what the American public viewed as the greatest threat to the world, yet Congress won’t even lift the federal minimum wage to the inflation-adjusted level it reached in the 1960s. Indeed, answer this question on how Congress responds to inequality. More than one choice could be correct. Congressional leadership is showing resolve to slash: A) subsidies for private jets; B) the carried interest tax loophole for billionaires; C) food stamps; D) the estate tax on couples with estates worth more than $10.9 million. The answer is C and D — steps that would hurt low-income children while offering a helping hand to billionaires. Congress is addressing inequality by exacerbating it at both ends. Inequality is a tough problem, but we have tools that could begin to make a difference. The problem isn’t inequality; the problem is us. We’re paralyzed. \nI invite you to sign up for my free, twice-weekly newsletter. When you do , you’ll receive an email about my columns as they’re published   Sign up here.

      "text": " MOSCOW — Maya Plisetskaya, one of the greatest ballerinas of the 20th century and virtually the embodiment of the Bolshoi Theater for decades, died of a heart attack in Munich on Saturday at age 89..\nMs. Plisetskaya, renowned for her fluidity of movement, expressive acting and willful personality, danced on the Bolshoi stage well into her 60s. Vadim Gaevsky, a dance historian and critic who followed Ms. Plisetskaya’s career once said of her that she “began by creating her own style and ended up creating her own theater.”\nMs. Plisetskaya was born in Moscow on Nov. 20, 1925. Her mother was a silent-film actress and her father an engineer who was posted as a Soviet mining official to Spitzbergen, Norway. Ms. Plisetskaya spent part of her childhood there. Her father, Mikhail Plisetsky, had a job that was to prove fateful: he was arrested in 1937 and shot to death in 1938, a victim of Stalin’s purges. Ms. Plisetskaya learned the date of his death only in 1989, during perestroika.\nHer mother, Rakhil, was arrested and sent to labor cap with her infant son and then exiled to Kazakhstan.\nPhoto Ms. Plisetskaya in 1996. Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Those tragic early events stamped the future ballerina with an enduring anti-Soviet streak that often teetered on the edge of dissidence, but another family connection and her innate talent predominated. Ms. Plisetskaya’s maternal aunt and uncle were Sulamith and Asaf Messerer, famous soloists at the Bolshoi who then continued as teachers at the theater’s ballet school.\nIn her autobiography, “I, Maya Plisetskaya,” published in 1994 and written, she stressed in its opening sentence, “by myself,” she describes tension with her aunt, who took her in during her mother’s arrest and saved her from being sent to the orphanages to which children of “enemies of the people” were usually relegated.\nShe remained close to her uncle, who still taught at the Bolshoi and accompanied her on tour to the United States when Ms. Plisetskaya was in her 60s and he in his 80s. But, wrote Ms. Plisetskaya, her aunt, known in the family as Mita, exacted a wrenching emotional cost for her kindness and over the years their relations soured and then broke off completely.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Ms. Messerer was infuriated when Ms. Plisetskaya refused to take her son, Misha, newly graduated from the ballet school, as her partner in “Swan Lake,” Siegfried to her already classic Odette/Odile.\n“She cut off my embarrassed and meek objections: ‘You owe me everything. Was it in vain that I petitioned for your mother and resisted when they came to take you to the orphanage?’ ”\nIt was Mita who had brought 8-year-old Maya to the Bolshoi Ballet Academy where she both shone for her talent and stood out for her stubbornness. She was known from earliest childhood for her endless reserves of energy and daring. In her autobiography, Ms. Plisetskaya recalls breaking into dance, and gathering an admiring crowd, while walking with her nanny along a Moscow boulevard.\nMs. Plisetskaya undertook the grueling whirl of Bolshoi training. Stalinist Russia, however, was an overwhelming presence that colored her memories of her growing accomplishments as a dancer, which she clearly relished.\nContinue reading the main story Continue reading the main story “I would like to talk about “Sleeping Beauty” and “Swan Lake,” about my battements and my handsome partners,” she wrote. “But whichever way I look at my childhood, it all revolves around politics and Stalin’s terror.”\nAs an adolescent she was already a rising star at the school and assigned the leading role in the divertissement from “Paquita,” to be performed before an elite audience: officials of the NKVD, Stalin’s secret police. In 1949 she danced at Stalin’s 70th birthday celebration. Mao was among the guests.\nPhoto Maya Plisetskaya after performing in \"Swan Lake\" at the Bolshoi Theater in 1995. Credit Grigory Dukor/Reuters “Years later, I admit it, I was simply afraid of meeting Stalin’s gaze,” she wrote in her autobiography, saying she avoided looking the Soviet dictator’s way during her bows. She also admitted to pleasure and relief at seeing her name in the report of TASS, the official Soviet news agency, on the birthday celebration. It was a sign of approval and would give her some modicum of artistic freedom, she hoped.\nBut in “I, Maya Plisetskaya,” she went on to chronicle the various indignities to which the system subjected dancers. In the 1950s, she was not allowed to travel abroad. When she was finally permitted to travel, she experienced how the Soviet bureaucracy confiscated almost all of a dancer’s tour earnings and saw how on tour many subsisted on dog and cat food (“cheap and full of vitamins,” she writes).\nMs. Plisetskaya was equally restricted by the Bolshoi’s rigid Soviet strictures on choreography, which viewed the very movement of dance through the prism of ideology, yet she was able to infuse stultified, literal movements with much deeper meaning.\nAnna Kisselgoff of The New York Times wrote of the 62-year-old Ms. Plisetskaya’s performances at an American-Soviet dance festival in Boston in 1988: “ These ballets are strictly vehicles for her talent. Without her presence, their poverty of movement invention would make them untenable in performance. It is a tragedy of Soviet ballet that a dancer of her singular genius was never extended creatively.”\nSpeaking to reporters during her 80th birthday festivities, Ms. Plisetskaya acknowledged her regret at the lost opportunities and the bitter struggle for each breath of artistic freedom, including permission, just barely and briefly, to work with Roland Petit and Maurice Bejart in the 1970s.\n“I danced all of classical ballet and dreamed of something new,” she said. “In my time it was impossible.”\nIn the 1960s, ideology played a trick in her favor, at least at first. The choreographer Alberto Alonso’s Cuban pedigree friendship with Fidel Castro was prized at the time, and garnered a bureaucratic green light for “Carmen Suite,” which he created for Ms. Plisetskaya. But then officials, unnerved by its eroticism, tried to scuttle the production.\nMs. Plisetskaya became director of the Spanish National Ballet in 1988 and traveled extensively, giving master classes around the world, as the Soviet system eased and then collapsed. Her most tender and enduring partnership was with Rodion Shchedrin, the Russian composer who arranged “Carmen Suite” and other ballets, such as “Anna Karenina” and “The Seagull,” which she choreographed and in which she starred. They married in 1958. Ms. Plisetskaya is survived by her husband and a brother, Azari Plisetsky, who was also a dancer and is known as a choreographer as well. He lives in Lausanne, Switzerland, where he teaches at the Bejart Ballet Lausanne.\nIt was her powerful physical relationship with the Bolshoi that gripped the dance world’s imagination, and, as she described it, kept her from leaving the Soviet Union.\n“The theater itself is incredibly constructed, the size of the stage, the incline of the floor,” she said. “I don’t know what kind of wood it’s made of, but it’s a spring. At other theaters the floor is either flat or the incline is too big. I’ve danced on all the big stages of the world, and I can say for sure that the Bolshoi was the very best.”\nLoading...

      "title": "Economic View: Andreessen Horowitz, Deal Maker to the Stars of Silicon Valley",
      "text": "Andreessen Horowitz, Deal Maker to the Stars of Silicon Valley MAY 1, 2015 Continue reading the main story Since its founding in 2009, Andreessen Horowitz has become a top Silicon Valley venture capital firm by adhering to a simple mantra: It’s all about the talent. The firm looks closely at business plans, market analysis and the details of new technologies, of course. But whenever possible, it answers funding pitches from entrepreneurs within a few days rather than stringing them along indefinitely, as was customary in the industry. It employs dozens of people who help start-up founders with marketing, hiring and business development — providing fledgling companies with insider knowledge and connections they rarely have on their own. “They have 100 people on staff, who almost become your employees,” said Ben Milne, a founder of an Andreessen-funded financial services start-up called Dwolla. See More » In some ways, Andreessen Horowitz is a talent agency as much as a tech investor. Marc Andreessen, the web pioneer who was a founder of Netscape and other companies before trying his hand at venture capital, has made this point explicitly. At a private event in 2010, a video of which The Wall Street Journal made public, he interviewed Michael Ovitz, the onetime Hollywood superagent who started Creative Artists Agency. Photo The venture capital firm led by Marc Andreessen has a pro-talent stance that attracts tech founders but can make returns relatively modest. Credit Robert Galbraith/Reuters “A lot of what we’re trying to do at Andreessen Horowitz is based directly on Michael’s experience building C.A.A.,” Mr. Andreessen told the Silicon Valley big shots assembled for the occasion. The firm declined to comment for this article. Similarities between the two businesses run deep. It’s not just that the Andreessen Horowitz partners, including Mr. Andreessen’s longtime collaborator, Ben Horowitz, realized that a V.C. firm could be run like a talent agency. It’s that the economics of Silicon Valley are uncannily similar to those of Hollywood. And by exploiting that insight, they may have helped inflate a tech bubble. For all the attention Mr. Ovitz lavished on his stars — Creative Artists partners sat on boards of hospitals and private schools so they could help clients win preferential treatment — by far the most important things he procured for them were money and control. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In the mid-1970s, when Mr. Ovitz founded C.A.A., the breakdown of the traditional studio system had created a world in which stars had potentially enormous if little appreciated leverage. “For 60 years, the studios really took advantage of the creative talent,” Mr. Ovitz said in an interview. “We tried to change the entire curve.” The studios still craved stars but no longer had formal sway over them through long-term contracts. Mr. Ovitz assembled a murderers’ row of clients and used their collective power to win them fantastically lucrative business terms. “Ovitz said, ‘I’m going to straighten out your life,’ and he made a deal for me with Universal,” Martin Scorsese said in 1999 . “They built these offices and screening room and helped me with my film foundation.” The firm also represented Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise and Glenn Close. Continue reading the main story Mr. Andreessen, for his part, exploited a shift in power from venture capitalists to start-up founders in Silicon Valley. In the 1970s, V.C.s fronted entrepreneurs relatively small sums for large equity stakes in their start-ups. By the 2000s, however, new technologies trimmed the cost of getting a company off the ground. “We estimated that it costs 10 percent what it cost even 10 years ago to start a software company,” said David Golden of Revolution Ventures. Deep-pocketed individual investors known as angels also made it possible for nearly anyone to start a company without a V.C.’s help. By the time an entrepreneur met with one, the business was more likely to be growing exponentially, making the V.C. the supplicant. Venture capital used to be about ferreting out the best deals, said Naval Ravikant, a longtime investor who founded the investment syndication site AngelList. Now, he says, “the question is who gets access.” Andreessen Horowitz’s pro-talent stance has helped win over founders, but as with Creative Artists the key to its recruiting success has been the allure of highly favorable financial terms. The way the typical venture capital deal works is that the V.C. will place a “pre-money” valuation on the company he or she is hoping to fund, then add an equity stake on top of it. For example, if the V.C. deems the company to be worth $40 million before the investment, and invests $10 million, the V.C. will then own 20 percent of the company, now valued at $50 million. The higher the valuation, the better it is for the entrepreneur, who gives up less equity for a given amount of cash. Within Silicon Valley, Andreessen Horowitz is famous for bidding valuations to heights that make rivals uncomfortable. To offset the dilution of ownership that comes from such prices, Andreessen Horowitz — which says it manages $4.2 billion in assets — increases the amount of money it invests. The firm often kicks in more than the entrepreneur asks for, according to rival V.C.s who have been involved in these deals. (Some investors agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity.) “They want to basically change the table stakes in a poker game,” said Greg Kidd, an angel investor in several companies Andreessen later funded. “There are some other folks who can cut checks like that, but there aren’t that many.” Venture capitalists who have bid against Andreessen Horowitz say the firm often comes in 50 to 100 percent higher than many other bidders, as when it led an ill-advised $40 million investment round in a daily deal site called Fab in 2011, which valued the company at $200 million. (The firm has occasionally passed on big deals, like one with Uber , that it felt were too costly.) These prices are flattering to the entrepreneur, who suddenly runs a company worth twice as much on paper as previously thought. It is an article of faith in Hollywood that hiring stars significantly increases the chances of scoring a blockbuster. Alas, this is not the case. Studying movies released between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s, Arthur S. De Vany, an expert on film economics, found that the participation of only 19 star actors and directors appeared to improve a movie’s chances of grossing more than $50 million. And the stars’ stunning paydays often leeched away studio profits. Continue reading the main story The forces that govern movies and start-ups are remarkably similar. They both follow what is known as a power-law distribution, meaning that the overwhelming majority of investments lose money, while a small fraction break even or become marginally profitable, and an even smaller fraction become wildly successful. Mr. Andreessen and his partners seem to believe they’re playing a role analogous to that of Mr. Ovitz and his fellow superagents: They do what it takes to lock up talent, which they eventually sell to someone else at a huge markup. This generates profits for themselves and a nice payday for the stars, whether they are Hollywood celebrities or entrepreneurs. But what if the Andreessen Horowitz partners have the analogy wrong? Rather than profiting like Mr. Ovitz and his fellow agents, the venture capitalists may be more like the Hollywood studios — chronically overpaying for projects whose costs they can rarely recoup. Mr. Andreessen and his partners have invested so much in so many start-ups that it would take a remarkable string of successes to make the approach pay off. For all their skill — the firm bought into the likes of Airbnb, Instagram and Pinterest relatively early — their track record suggests it’s unlikely. Already, they’ve suffered a few impressive flameouts, including Fab, on which they are likely to lose tens of millions of dollars. Even when they pick well, they often bid so much for stars that the return is relatively modest. It’s easier to triple or quadruple your money when you’ve invested $10 million in a $100 million company than when you’ve invested nearly $100 million in a $1 billion company, as they did with the daily deal site Zulily. There are only so many companies that are acquired for billions of dollars or reach that kind of price through an initial public offering. Fewer retain such valuations — Zulily’s stock price has fallen sharply since last year. More than is the case with other firms, the fate of Andreessen Horowitz may be closely tied to that of the overall tech market. If prices remain buoyant, the eye-popping valuations of the firm’s top-performing companies will keep it profitable and losses will be containable. But if the market turns, Andreessen Horowitz could have serious trouble. Worse, Andreessen Horowitz isn’t just a beneficiary of behavior that’s driving up valuations. If a bubble is forming, it is ultimately because too much money is chasing too few companies. But the firm’s own aggressive bidding may be partly responsible. “Because there is competition for deals, when you have actors in the market showing no price discipline, it drives up the cost for everyone,” said one investor. Naturally, Mr. Andreessen has argued that the tech market is rational — that tectonic forces, like the proliferation of smartphones , have fundamentally changed the value of popular software. But even Mr. Andreessen has expressed some concern. Last September, he posted on Twitter : “When the market turns, and it will turn, we will find out who has been swimming without trunks on.” He warned that companies that hadn’t conserved their cash would “vaporize.” It may have been a plea to entrepreneurs on whom his firm had lavished tens of millions of dollars. Stars have many virtues. But the lesson taught by Hollywood is that they tend to make everyone poorer but themselves. \nThe Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

      "text": "Maya Plisetskaya, Ballerina Who Embodied Bolshoi, Dies at 89 By SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY Continue reading the main story MOSCOW — Maya Plisetskaya, one of the greatest ballerinas of the 20th century and virtually the embodiment of the Bolshoi Theater for decades, died of a heart attack in Munich on Saturday at age 89. Ms. Plisetskaya, renowned for her fluidity of movement, expressive acting and willful personality, danced on the Bolshoi stage well into her 60s. Vadim Gaevsky, a dance historian and critic who followed Ms. Plisetskaya’s career once said of her that she “began by creating her own style and ended up creating her own theater.” Her death was confirmed by Katya Novikova, the Bolshoi’s press secretary. Ms. Plisetskaya was born in Moscow on Nov. 20, 1925. Her mother was a silent-film actress and her father an engineer who was posted as a Soviet mining official to Spitzbergen, Norway. Ms. Plisetskaya spent part of her childhood there. Her father, Mikhail Plisetsky, had a job that was to prove fateful: he was arrested in 1937 and shot to death in 1938, a victim of Stalin’s purges. Ms. Plisetskaya learned the date of his death only in 1989, during perestroika. Photo Ms. Plisetskaya in 1996. Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Her mother, Rakhil, was arrested and sent to labor cap with her infant son and then exiled to Kazakhstan. Those tragic early events stamped the future ballerina with an enduring anti-Soviet streak that often teetered on the edge of dissidence, but another family connection and her innate talent predominated. Ms. Plisetskaya’s maternal aunt and uncle were Sulamith and Asaf Messerer, famous soloists at the Bolshoi who then continued as teachers at the theater’s ballet school. In her autobiography, “I, Maya Plisetskaya,” published in 1994 and written, she stressed in its opening sentence, “by myself,” she describes tension with her aunt, who took her in during her mother’s arrest and saved her from being sent to the orphanages to which children of “enemies of the people” were usually relegated. She remained close to her uncle, who still taught at the Bolshoi and accompanied her on tour to the United States when Ms. Plisetskaya was in her 60s and he in his 80s. But, wrote Ms. Plisetskaya, her aunt, known in the family as Mita, exacted a wrenching emotional cost for her kindness and over the years their relations soured and then broke off completely. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Messerer was infuriated when Ms. Plisetskaya refused to take her son, Misha, newly graduated from the ballet school, as her partner in “Swan Lake,” Siegfried to her already classic Odette/Odile. “She cut off my embarrassed and meek objections: ‘You owe me everything. Was it in vain that I petitioned for your mother and resisted when they came to take you to the orphanage?’ ” It was Mita who had brought 8-year-old Maya to the Bolshoi Ballet Academy where she both shone for her talent and stood out for her stubbornness. She was known from earliest childhood for her endless reserves of energy and daring. In her autobiography, Ms. Plisetskaya recalls breaking into dance, and gathering an admiring crowd, while walking with her nanny along a Moscow boulevard. Continue reading the main story Ms. Plisetskaya undertook the grueling whirl of Bolshoi training. Stalinist Russia, however, was an overwhelming presence that colored her memories of her growing accomplishments as a dancer, which she clearly relished. “I would like to talk about “Sleeping Beauty” and “Swan Lake,” about my battements and my handsome partners,” she wrote. “But whichever way I look at my childhood, it all revolves around politics and Stalin’s terror.” Photo Maya Plisetskaya after performing in \"Swan Lake\" at the Bolshoi Theater in 1995. Credit Grigory Dukor/Reuters As an adolescent she was already a rising star at the school and assigned the leading role in the divertissement from “Paquita,” to be performed before an elite audience: officials of the NKVD, Stalin’s secret police. In 1949 she danced at Stalin’s 70th birthday celebration. Mao was among the guests. “Years later, I admit it, I was simply afraid of meeting Stalin’s gaze,” she wrote in her autobiography, saying she avoided looking the Soviet dictator’s way during her bows. She also admitted to pleasure and relief at seeing her name in the report of TASS, the official Soviet news agency, on the birthday celebration. It was a sign of approval and would give her some modicum of artistic freedom, she hoped. But in “I, Maya Plisetskaya,” she went on to chronicle the various indignities to which the system subjected dancers. In the 1950s, she was not allowed to travel abroad. When she was finally permitted to travel, she experienced how the Soviet bureaucracy confiscated almost all of a dancer’s tour earnings and saw how on tour many subsisted on dog and cat food (“cheap and full of vitamins,” she writes). Ms. Plisetskaya was equally restricted by the Bolshoi’s rigid Soviet strictures on choreography, which viewed the very movement of dance through the prism of ideology, yet she was able to infuse stultified, literal movements with much deeper meaning. Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times wrote of the 62-year-old Ms. Plisetskaya’s performances at an American-Soviet dance festival in Boston in 1988: “ These ballets are strictly vehicles for her talent. Without her presence, their poverty of movement invention would make them untenable in performance. It is a tragedy of Soviet ballet that a dancer of her singular genius was never extended creatively.” Speaking to reporters during her 80th birthday festivities, Ms. Plisetskaya acknowledged her regret at the lost opportunities and the bitter struggle for each breath of artistic freedom, including permission, just barely and briefly, to work with Roland Petit and Maurice Bejart in the 1970s. “I danced all of classical ballet and dreamed of something new,” she said. “In my time it was impossible.” In the 1960s, ideology played a trick in her favor, at least at first. The choreographer Alberto Alonso’s Cuban pedigree friendship with Fidel Castro was prized at the time, and garnered a bureaucratic green light for “Carmen Suite,” which he created for Ms. Plisetskaya. But then officials, unnerved by its eroticism, tried to scuttle the production. Ms. Plisetskaya became director of the Spanish National Ballet in 1988 and traveled extensively, giving master classes around the world, as the Soviet system eased and then collapsed. Her most tender and enduring partnership was with Rodion Shchedrin, the Russian composer who arranged “Carmen Suite” and other ballets, such as “Anna Karenina” and “The Seagull,” which she choreographed and in which she starred. They married in 1958. Ms. Plisetskaya is survived by her husband and a brother, Azari Plisetsky, who was also a dancer and is known as a choreographer as well. He lives in Lausanne, Switzerland, where he teaches at the Bejart Ballet Lausanne. It was her powerful physical relationship with the Bolshoi that gripped the dance world’s imagination, and, as she described it, kept her from leaving the Soviet Union. “The theater itself is incredibly constructed, the size of the stage, the incline of the floor,” she said. “I don’t know what kind of wood it’s made of, but it’s a spring. At other theaters the floor is either flat or the incline is too big. I’ve danced on all the big stages of the world, and I can say for sure that the Bolshoi was the very best.” Loading...",

American Pharoah, last year’s 2-year-old champion, gave Baffert his fourth victory in the Derby; he previously won with Silver Charm (1997), Real Quiet (1998) and War Emblem (2002).

      "text": "OPEN Timeline The charges reveal the step-by-step, carefully coordinated attention paid by the three associates of the governor to create the perfect traffic jam, a veritable town-size parking lot, one that in the end may have stymied Mr. Christie’s presidential ambitions. Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly have proclaimed their innocence, saying that Mr. Wildstein, who is cooperating with the authorities, fabricated stories about their actions to help his case. The hinge of the plot Mr. Wildstein has outlined for the authorities was a uniquely New Jersey form of punishment: making suburban drivers sit in traffic. The first mention of it came in March 2011, as Mr. Christie’s star among national Republicans was first rising. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Wildstein, then the chief of staff to Mr. Baroni, Mr. Christie’s top staff appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , mentioned to Mr. Baroni that they could use the local access lanes to the bridge from Fort Lee as leverage against the town’s mayor, Mark Sokolich. Mr. Christie’s strategists were hoping to use his 2013 re-election campaign to build a case for him to run for president. Their goal was to secure endorsements from a broad spectrum of officials, including Democrats such as Mayor Sokolich. This cultivating fell mostly to young staff members in the wing of Mr. Christie’s front office known as Intergovernmental Affairs. In August 2013, Ms. Kelly, the deputy chief of staff in that office, expressed disappointment to Mr. Wildstein that Mr. Sokolich, who had been the subject of intense wooing by her office and the authority, was not going to endorse Mr. Christie. Ms. Kelly, like Mr. Baroni and Mr. Wildstein, was a loyal lieutenant, who joined the governor and members of his inner circle at events outside of work. Continue reading the main story Mr. Wildstein mentioned the lanes as a source of leverage. Ms. Kelly called a young employee and instructed him to confirm that Mr. Sokolich had refrained from an endorsement, then emailed Mr. Wildstein: “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.” That was mid-August. In the coming days, she confirmed again that Mr. Sokolich would not endorse. And she instructed her employees not to “interact” with him. Photo Bill Baroni was appointed by Mr. Christie to the Port Authority. Credit Chris Pedota/The Record, via Associated Press A week later Mr. Wildstein and Ms. Kelly joked in their text messages about punishing a rabbi who had also fallen into disfavor. “We cannot cause traffic problems in front of his house, can we?” Ms. Kelly wrote. “Flights to Tel Aviv all mysteriously delayed,” Mr. Wildstein countered. “Perfect,” she replied. The three then made up a cover story: They would say that they were doing a traffic study so that unwitting Port Authority staff members would go along with the plan, making it appear to be legitimate. That would require some planning and the involvement of unwitting participants. Mr. Wildstein had a traffic engineer prepare several configurations; Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly agreed that the one that funneled three access lanes into a single one would inflict the worst punishment on the mayor, by creating the most severe traffic backup on the streets of Fort Lee. They would steer that lane to a tollbooth that accepted cash as well as E-ZPass; there would be no access to the E-ZPass-only lane that offered a faster commute. They were ready in August, but Mr. Baroni recommended waiting. After all, traffic tended to be lighter in summer; “the punitive impact would be lessened,” the indictment says. They bided their time. They agreed: They would do it the first day of school, Monday, Sept. 9, 2013, in order to “intensify Mayor Sokolich’s punishment.” They agreed not to tell him, or any officials in Fort Lee, so that there would be no time to prepare. It would also, the indictment says, “keep Fort Lee residents and G.W.B. commuters from altering their routes.” And though the three had agreed on the date, they also agreed not to share it with any Port Authority workers involved in the closings until the Friday before, to avoid any leaks. They understood that closing down lanes to the world’s busiest bridge would not be uncomplicated, or inexpensive. Mr. Wildstein brought in a backup toll collector who had to be paid overtime, in case the one on duty had to go the bathroom. He had traffic engineers rush that Friday to collect data for a fake traffic study. The police would have to work through an extended rush hour.",

      "title": "Mayor de Blasio Defends Police Response to Freddie Gray Protests in New York",
      "text": "APRIL 30, 2015 Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, convened a news conference after hearing complaints about the police response from allies like the Rev. Al Sharpton. “I’ve participated in plenty of protests, on plenty of issues,” the mayor said. “I believe deeply in how nonviolent protest has achieved social change.” Photo Many marched to protest the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Credit Michael Appleton for The New York Times But, he added: “When the police give you instruction, you follow the instruction. It’s not debatable.” The arrests on Wednesday, which prompted a protest from liberal groups outside Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan, came amid a renewed debate in New York over aggressive police tactics, including an effort by the City Council to decriminalize low-level offenses, like public urination. But Mr. de Blasio’s attitude was a far cry from late last year, when he allowed similar demonstrations to spill into the city’s highways and avenues. That episode, after a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict an officer in the death of a Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, contributed to an open law enforcement rebellion against the mayor. On Thursday, as in the past on police issues, Mr. de Blasio seemed to struggle to walk a tightrope. Even as Mr. Bratton, in a separate news conference, acknowledged a “much more assertive” approach to handling street protests, the mayor insisted that “the strategic approach is exactly the same.” But the mayor eventually allowed that some “tactical adjustments” had been made in response to past cases in which officers had been injured, including a march across the Brooklyn Bridge. The result was a strained, and at times testy display by a mayor trying to balance liberal sympathies with the burdens of overseeing a police force whose tactics he once criticized. Mr. de Blasio grew visibly frustrated at the notion that the police in Union Square had been too aggressive with protesters, telling reporters, “If you guys want to sensationalize, if you think that’s your contribution to society, feel free.” Photo Police arrested 143 demonstrators. Credit Michael Appleton for The New York Times He lamented that the news media did not focus on what he cited as his accomplishments in police reform, like a drop in civilian complaints against the Police Department.   In a telling shift, Mr. de Blasio rebuked his interlocutors for suggesting that some of the protesters arrested on Wednesday had done little to provoke a tough police response. In December, after the Garner protests, he lashed out at a journalist who suggested that some protesters had acted violently. To the city’s liberal advocates — some of whom had marched alongside Mr. de Blasio during his candidate days — the mayor’s response was disappointing. “All I heard was, ‘Listen to the police, do what the police say,’ ” said Gideon Oliver, a civil rights lawyer who represents a group that organized the rally. “If the mayor’s answer to problems of abuse of police discretion is ‘just listen to what police say,’ that’s obviously a very big problem.” Still, Mr. Bratton and police officials were adamant that they had acted appropriately to rein in a demonstration that was threatening to become unruly and disrupt the city’s evening rush. “Throughout the night we were extremely flexible,” Chief James P. O’Neill said at the Police Academy in Queens. “If the protests continue, we will continue to be flexible. It’s not just one strategy.” Chief O’Neill added that one precinct captain, the commander of the 13th Precinct in Manhattan, had been struck in the head with a stick. “He’s got a nice cut on his jaw,” he said. Photo Some protesters sought to block traffic. Credit Michael Abbott/Getty Images One veteran city supervisor, who was at Union Square on Wednesday, said he had been told at the onset that the police might take a more assertive approach than in past protests. “They were free to protest on the sidewalk, and follow the law, and we would certainly let them express their rights,” said the supervisor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to detail department policies. “But if they broke the law, went into the street and stuff like that, we weren’t going to give them much and were going to start locking people up.” Aside from the arrests, the supervisor said, the night went smoothly. “No major fights,” he said. “No major assaults on cops, or cops doing anything crazy to anyone else.” Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday that the city would not take an “ironclad” approach to future protests, and would consider each demonstration case by case. “It’s a big, complicated city,” the mayor said. “I have confidence, having been a public servant, having been a protester, that the N.Y.P.D. knows how to work out every situation.” A reporter pointed out that Mr. de Blasio himself had been arrested during his run for mayor, as a show of civil disobedience to protest the closing of a public hospital in Brooklyn. The mayor scoffed and said there was no comparison to what transpired on Wednesday night. His own arrest, Mr. de Blasio said, “was the most choreographed thing on earth.” Correction: April 30, 2015 An earlier version of this article misstated where Chief James P. O’Neill spoke on Thursday about the Police Department’s response to protests in Manhattan. He was at the Police Academy in Queens, not Police Headquarters. \nMatt Flegenheimer, J.

      "text": "Mayweather vs. Pacquiao Live Blog The New York Times Join Us for a Virtual Ringside Seat As far as fights of the century go, tonight’s bout between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao seemingly has it all, with two fighters with contrasting personalities, considered the best pound-for-pound boxers of their generation, meeting for the first time. The combatants are projected to split a $300 million payday, and over $100 million is expected to be wagered in Nevada on the outcome. The undercard starts at 9 p.m. E.S.T., but Mayweather and Pacquiao aren’t expected to be in the ring until 11 p.m. at the earliest. Follow us here for fight updates and analysis. May 2, 2015 A Role Reversal Tonight? Floyd Mayweather Jr. is rarely, if ever, considered to be an aggressor in a fight. But if his father, who is also his trainer, is to be believed, the world could see a different Mayweather tonight against Manny Pacquiao. “Floyd’s going to fight him tomorrow, believe me,” Floyd Sr. said during a brief interview on Friday after the weigh-in. The elder Mayweather suggested that Pacquiao, one of the sport’s most relentless attackers, might be the one shying away from a battle. “If he runs, Floyd’s going to cut him off,” Floyd Sr. said. “If he go backward, Floyd going to walk him down.” There was a caveat to the strategy, however. It’s all about timing, Floyd Sr. said. “When we decide when Floyd wants to do it,” he said. “It’s all about picking his spots and picking the right time to do what you got to do. We going to definitely bring it to him, believe me.” It actually should not be all that shocking if Mayweather comes out aggressively. In his recent fights, Mayweather has shown more of a willingness to trade blows in the center of the ring, without dancing like he is prone to do. In consecutive fights against Marcos Maidana, Mayweather withstood some punishing flurries from his feisty, and at times wild, opponent, gamely firing off at close range. Pacquiao’s trainer, Freddie Roach, has suggested that he would welcome something of a role reversal tonight. He said he wanted his fighter to lure Mayweather in and do some countering. In an interview on Friday, Roach warned Mayweather against one of his favored punches — a jab to the body. That punch would provide the perfect setup for a Pacquiao right hook, Roach said. “If he throws the jab to the body and Manny stays in the pocket,” Roach said, Manny “will knock him out. He’ll be over.” Of course, everyone in boxing is prone to tough talk. It remains to be seen if either fighter will fight in the way he traditionally fights. May 2, 2015 Organizing Entrances and Exits Sometimes, the real scares at a major boxing match comes after it is over. After last year’s fight between Floyd Mayweather and Marcos Maidana at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, dozens were injured as they tried to leave . Most exits take fans through a corridor of shops and restaurants leading to the casino. An escalator fed unsuspecting fans into a crush of people, toppling many over. Another bottleneck led to the cascading crash of a store window, and the toppling of a partition at Starbucks, which some interpreted as gunfire. People surged to escape, some falling to the ground. Tables and chairs in front of a yogurt shop were knocked over, and some even jumped over the counter to escape the chaos. On Saturday afternoon, the MGM Grand was packed, especially near the sports book. But in the corridor of shops leading to the arena, known as the district, security had set up a gate and was allowing only ticket holders and those with room keys to enter the area. If there is a stampede this year, it will not be before the fight. May 2, 2015 More Backstage Gamesmanship Between Mayweather and Pacquiao LAS VEGAS — More about the gloves. The Floyd Mayweather Jr. camp earlier complained about Manny Pacquiao’s gloves, arguing that the padding contained horsehair and thus violated a contract between the fighters. A similar issue nearly derailed a fight between Mayweather and Marcos Maidana a year ago, when the state commission did not approve Maidana’s Everlast gloves. This time, the Mayweather camp wanted Les Moonves, the president and chief executive of CBS, to be the arbiter, as the fight contract stipulates when the two sides are at a negotiating impasse. Pacquiao’s side argued that the state commission had already approved the gloves. Ultimately, Mayweather’s side withdrew its protest. The fighters were allowed to choose their set of gloves. It amounted to backstage gamesmanship common to boxing, sometimes used to plant doubts or distract the opponent. May 2, 2015 Freddie Roach, Manny Pacquiao’s longtime trainer, had one thought when he saw the boxing gloves that Floyd Mayweather chose to wear for their fight on Saturday night. “He’s going to go for the kill,” Roach said. “It’s a dead giveaway.” Days before a bout, boxers must submit several pairs of gloves to the Nevada State Athletic Commission for inspection. On Friday night, the opposing sides came to the MGM Grand Garden Arena and, in front of the other side, chose which pair of gloves that they would wear and which would serve as a backup. The gloves were marked “1” and “2” and placed in sealed bags. Mayweather represented himself. Roach came to represent Pacquiao, who did not attend. He was surprised by Mayweather’s choice of gloves, a two-toned pair (red and gold) made by Grant. Gloves weight 8 ounces, but they have different amounts of padding, depending on the ratio of protection and punch the boxer wants them to provide. “The Grants are the smallest gloves I’ve ever seen,” Roach said on Saturday morning, over a long and relaxed breakfast. “I can’t believe he picked them. He usually has a lot of padding. But he’s going to try to knock us out in the first round.” For Pacquiao, Roach chose a red pair by Reyes. Roach said that Mayweather declined the opportunity to put his hands inside Pacquiao’s gloves, as rules allow. But Roach gladly tried on Mayweather’s gloves., raising hackles from Mayweather and the small crew that accompanied him, including Leonard Ellerbe, chief executive of Mayweather Promotions. “He’s going to struggle to get his taped hands in there,” Roach said Saturday morning. “They’re tight.” Mayweather wanted another chance, Roach said, but it was too late. Before the fight, the boxers will have their hands taped, with strict rules about the method. Up to 10 feet of gauze can be wrapped around the fingers, and athletic tape must stay on the hands and wrists, not building over the ridge of the first knuckle. This fight disallowed “rolls” – tightly rolled pieces of tape, looking like dough rolled into skinny worms, placed between the knuckles at the bottom of the finger. Roach said that he would go tell Pacquaio about the taping rules after breakfast. But before he could leave, a clamor rose in the hall outside the casino restaurant. It was Pacquiao, trailed by fans and accompanied by part of his entourage, entering a conference room for his morning prayer. He finished his French toast and bacon. A few fans approached and were shooed away before they reached Roach, while others took photos from a distance. Roach wondered aloud why Mayweather would wear two-toned gloves that were different colors than his backup pair. If one glove gets damaged, he would have to replace both, because the gloves must match. That would give Pacquiao more time to rest. Roach had more coffee. He said he would enter Mayweather’s locker room, amid his entourage, and closely watch Mayweather’s hands being taped. “He uses a lot of wrap,” Roach said. “Small hands. And he knows I know the rules.” Roach planned to do something else while he was in Mayweather’s locker room, also allowed under boxing rules. “I will try the gloves on again,” he said. “And they’ll go crazy again.” May 2, 2015 Quiet Before the Storm Photo The seats are empty, as is the ring, prior to the fight Saturday.
