Last week, people were being evacuated to Puerto Montt on 22 buses and military trucks, the Interior Ministry said. Officials said that volcanic flows from Calbuco caused rising water levels in the RÃ­o Blanco. A column of ash and lava from the Calbuco Volcano is viisble from Puerto Varas, Chile, on April 22. The first eruption set off a bit of a panic in the region. \"At the beginning, it was small, and later, the cloud grew. And later, there was a huge cloud over you and true terror starts,\" a Puerto Montt resident said. Another person said: \"It was impressive to see an enormous mushroom cloud, with the immense force of the volcano, and to see the ashes. At that point, there was a lot of panic, lots of chaos, traffic jams, people going to supermarkets, everyone looking for water, trying to take out money from the ATMs.\" The eruption is a first for many in the region.The last major eruption was in 1962. There was a minor eruption in 1972. Calbuco also belched out a bit of gas and smoke in 1996.

      "text": "Congress forces its way into Iran deal Washington (CNN) CNN has learned that U.S. Navy warships will now accompany U.S.-flagged commercial vessels that pass through the Strait of Hormuz due to concerns that ships from Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps navy could try to seize a U.S. cargo ship. Pentagon officials provided clarification Thursday afternoon that not every ship will necessarily be accompanied by the Navy. But this is still a significant change in the U.S. military posture in the Strait. The classified plan was approved by the Pentagon earlier Thursday, according to a senior defense official. While the Navy maintains a routine ship presence in the Persian Gulf and the North Arabian Sea, this new effort specifically requires an armed warship to be in the narrow channel between Iran and Oman when a U.S. commercial vessel passes through. The decision to go ahead with this plan comes as Iran Revolutionary Guard ships harassed a U.S.-flagged vessel, the Maersk Kensington, on Friday and then later seized another cargo ship, the Maersk Tigris, flagged in the Marshall Islands. The worry is that with the uncertainty around Iran's intentions, any seizure of a U.S.-flagged vessel could provoke an international incident with Iran. \"This is a way to reduce the risk of confrontation,\" the official told CNN. The official emphasized the Navy is not trying to \"play up\" the current situation, but said the orders were approved \"based on tensions in the region.\" A second U.S. official said if it becomes necessary, U.S. warships are prepared to escort U.S. commercial vessels throughout the entire Gulf. There are a number of U.S. ships and aircraft in the immediate vicinity, including four ships and several aircraft monitoring the status of the Marshall Island vessel, which remains in Iranian custody allegedly over a 2005 financial dispute. U.S. Navy ships will be moved in and out of the area depending on the transit schedule of U.S. cargo vessels.

Hide Caption Iran parades military equipment 9 photos Iranian sailors march in the parade. Hide Caption 9 of 9 Iranian officials said the seizure of the Marshall Islands-flagged ship Maersk Tigris was due to a court decision. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Wednesday that the ship had \"some rather peculiar activity\" in its past that resulted in court action, according to lawyers with whom his ministry has been in touch. \"Simply, our naval forces implemented the decision of the court,\" he added. Rickmers Shipmanagement, the company managing the Maersk Tigris, a Maersk Line ship, said in a statement Thursday that the apparent issue dates back to 2005, when another Maersk Line vessel delivered a shipment to Dubai that was later disposed of when no one collected the containers. A spokesperson for Rickmers Shipmanagement also said that 24 people -- none American -- are on board the Maersk Tigris and that they are all doing well. However, the company continues to \"insist that the crew and vessel are released as soon as possible.\" READ: US aircraft carrier enters Persian Gulf as Iranian convoy moves away from Yemen The two recent incidents come after the U.S. last week sent warships to the vicinity of Yemen after concerns were raised that an Iranian convey was attempting to supply arms to Houthi rebels who have deposed the Western-backed government in Sanaa. Multiple U.S. officials said the American ships had been deployed to the region to dissuade the Iranian convoy, which included armed ships, from docking in Yemen. The Iranian ships turned away from Yemen on Thursday. The U.S. hope is that by deploying the naval accompaniment for cargo ships in the Strait of Hormuz, it's much less likely that Iran would cause trouble for them. Rather, like in the case of Yemen, they would be more inclined to turn back. Still, the move comes amidst U.S.-Iran tensions in the region over competing interests in Yemen and elsewhere. And it also coincides with delicate nuclear talks in the which the United States and five other world powers are trying to seal a final deal with Iran curbing the latter's nuclear program. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> Politics Originals Story by Chris Moody; Video by Alex Rosen and Jeremy Moorhead There are few things Americans have both loved and fought about more than alcohol.

Choices are nearly endless The National September 11 Memorial & Museum is the city's newest big attraction (CNN) The book \" 100 Things to Do in New York City Before You Die \" curates what it calls the most essential activities in the city. We've collected 12 of them here. All are located in Manhattan, unless noted. Sing karaoke at Arlene's Grocery You can't play a guitar like Jimi, you can't sing like Freddie and yet you dream of being a rock star like Bowie. Especially when you've been drinking. Sound familiar? Since 1996, this former bodega has been one of the primo showcases for local bands in NYC, and on Monday and Friday nights, their famous karaoke band gives accountants, baristas and repressed librarians a taste of the limelight. Even if you don't have it in you to take the stage, the drinks are cheap and the people watching ranges from \"wow\" to \"that's hilarious\" to \"what a train wreck.\" But no matter the level of talent, the entertainment factor goes to 11. Arlene's Grocery , 95 Stanton St.; +1 212 358 1633 Walk the High Line Considered this generation's Central Park, the 1.45 miles of reclaimed railroad track is testament to community activism and urban beautification efforts. Initially slated for demolition in 1999 until downtowners Joshua David and Robert Hammond started Friends of the High Line, the park now hosts more than 4.4 million visitors annually, which has actually become a problem. The path is only 30 feet wide in some places, causing a pleasant stroll to sometimes feel like waiting in line. So visit early in the morning or late in the evening, and avoid weekends at all cost. The High Line runs from Gansevoort Street to West 30th Street; +1 212 500 6035 Get a ticket at Katz's Delicatessen Ever wonder what pastrami is, exactly? It's beef brisket cured in brine and covered with a mix of spices that include garlic, paprika and mustard seed. Then it's steamed until the meat begins to break down. The process was a way of preserving meat before the age of refrigeration. Today, there are only three NYC delis to get a traditional pastrami sandwich: Carnegie Deli, 2nd Avenue Deli and Katz's Delicatessen. Each of these granddaddies have their share of history and old-timey charm, but Katz's undoubtedly delivers the best experience. Upon entering, you're given a ticket (which you better not lose!), and then you proceed to the counter to order (your ticket will get marked depending on what you order). If you're a traditionalist, you'll want pastrami on rye with mustard and a cup of matzo ball soup. A mound of pickles is thrown in for free. After taking that last delicious bite, take a stroll around the place to look at all the photos on the wall, and see if you can find the table where that scene from \"When Harry Met Sally\" was filmed. P.S. It's open late! Katz's Delicatessen , 205 E. Houston St; +1 212 254 2246 MORE: Where to find the funniest jokes in America Watch some noir at Film Forum There are several good independent movie theaters in New York, but the Forum stands alone as cinema's obsessive historian. The atmosphere of the theater itself somehow matches the mood of the carefully curated celluloid that lights up the big screen nightly. International noir from Jean-Luc Godard and classics by Orson Welles are house specialties, but so are little known gems like \"Scarecrow\" (starring Gene Hackman) and \"Public Enemy\" (which made Jimmy Cagney a star). So the next time you're wondering what to do on a Friday night, take a chance and catch a movie you've probably never heard of. Film Forum , 209 W. Houston St.; +1 212 727 8110 Shop at Bergdorf Goodman At the corner of 58th Street and Fifth Avenue, where a Vanderbilt mansion once stood, is the city's temple to high fashion and conspicuous consumption. Founded in 1899 by Herman Bergdorf, the department store carries all the usual -- Prada, Chanel -- but it's also known for identifying and selling the best from upstart designers from around the world. Splurge on something, even if it's only a glass of wine in Goodman's Cafe. Bergdorf Goodman , 754 Fifth Ave.; +1 212 753 7300 Cruise past the Statue of Liberty All those poor, tired, huddled masses would have headed straight back to the Old Country if they had to endure the lines that typically greet the patriots and tourists looking to visit Liberty Island. The best way to see America's First Lady is to take the Circle Line Sightseeing cruise, which departs from Pier 83, down the Hudson River. It passes this close by Lady Liberty before heading under the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. (There are lots of Circle Line cruise options, so make sure you choose the right one. And a good alternative is a ride on the Staten Island Ferry, which gets pretty close to Lady Liberty, runs regularly and is free.) Circle Line Sightseeing , Pier 83, W. 42nd St.; +1 212 563 3200 Rock out at the Bowery Ballroom Ever hear of The Go! Team? How about Joan Baez or Soul Asylum? If not, then chances are you're not cool. Don't worry, though! A quick fix is only a gig away at this tiny concert venue where bands from all over the world come to jam. The bar upstairs is a great place to amp up with friends before heading downstairs to get electrified by music not meant to be consumed by mass-market audiences. Obviously you should do some homework and see a band that interests you, but any night rocking out at the Ballroom will be a night to remember. Bowery Ballroom , 6 Delancey St.+1 212 533 2111 Explore the northwest area of Central Park Ask any New Yorker for a short list of must-sees in Central Park and they'll likely rattle off destinations like Strawberry Fields and Bethesda Fountain. But ask Central Park's historian, Sara Cedar Millar, for her favorite spot and she'll send you up north to the now defunct bridle paths. The area has a distinct topography (complete with waterfall), making it a favorite among naturalists and joggers alike. Central Park ; +1 212 310 6600 Visit the National September 11 Memorial & Museum Considering the unspeakable depravity that led to the creation of \"ground zero,\" the feeling of reverence, endurance, perseverance and peace that now greets visitors is truly astounding. More than 11 million people have come here from all over the world since it opened in 2011, and in so doing, paid tribute to the indomitable human spirit. The site is solemn, but it's also a place of wonder and learning, with the considerable effort of those who designed and built the memorial evident at every turn. The two massive reflecting pools that cascade water down into the footprints of the two felled towers are equal parts moving and beautiful. Bronze panels surrounding the pools bear the names of everyone who died in the attacks, and are arranged with delicate significance. The museum, located seven stories underground at the base of the original Twin Towers, curates a powerful and extensive exhibit that includes crushed fire trucks, salvaged steel tridents that once held up the towers, photographs and biographies of all those who perished in the attacks, including those of the terrorists, lest the world forgets who was responsible.",

      "text": "Dramatic rescue and aid operation in Nepal 03:33 Story highlights CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta was aboard an aid flight when a woman's pulse stopped Sabina Lama was injured when a ceiling fell on her during the Nepal earthquake Gupta gave her a 'cardiac thump' when she couldn't be roused Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) \"Please take her,\" people cried over the roar of the helicopter propellers as the flight was about to take off from one of the Nepali districts worst-hit by the earthquake. The Indian helicopter had just dropped aid to people forced to fend for themselves for days after the quake, in Sindhupalchowk, east of the capital Kathmandu. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta and a crew were aboard the flight, packed with instant noodles and tarps being delivered to people who no longer had -- or trusted -- a roof over their heads. The pilots hadn't expected to take on any passengers, but as they were about to take off, a woman lying on a makeshift straw stretcher was thrust toward the door. Her name is Sabina Lama. Soldiers carry Sabina on a makeshift straw stretcher in Kathmandu, April 30, 2015. Emergency on board Sabina, 18, was a new mother, and as Gupta examined her it soon became clear she had no feeling or movement in her legs. She'd been badly injured during the quake. But no one expected what happened next. Minutes into the flight, Sabina stopped breathing. \"We could no longer detect a pulse -- either in her wrist or in her neck. I checked her pupils, and tried desperately to rouse her, as we blasted over the countryside,\" Gupta recounted. There was no defibrillator on the helicopter that could be used to give a jolt to kick-start her heart, no fluids, no first aid kit, no medical equipment to deal with an emergency such as this. Sabina would die without proper medical care. With few options left, Gupta delivered a sharp blow to her chest. \"It is aggressive -- but I just delivered a 'cardiac thump,' a quick, strong hit to the chest in a last ditch effort to shock Sabina's heart back into action.\" It wasn't clear if it was the blow that did it, but either way, Sabina came back. Dr. Sanjay Gupta checks Sabina's pulse on board a helicopter flight from her quake-hit village, April 30, 2015. Flight to safety Sabina's pulse returned as the helicopter raced to a makeshift hospital high in the mountains where the crew picked up an IV drip to give her fluids. It was tied to the ceiling of the helicopter using a disposable face mask. More patients piled in as the helicopter headed to Kathmandu Airport, where ambulances were waiting with stretchers, medicine and other life-saving supplies. Amid the chaos, parts of Sabina's story emerged. On Saturday, she had been taking her six-week-old son to the health center in her village to get his scheduled vaccinations when the earthquake hit. As the earth shook, part of the ceiling collapsed, miraculously missing her baby, but delivering such a violent blow that she lost use of her legs. Her husband is now caring for the little boy as his mother receives the help she needs. She's just one of more than 13,000 people injured in an earthquake that has killed more than 6,000 people, and devastated a nation. JUST WATCHED ",

      "text": "Curfew comes with many protesters still out on streets Police commissioner says people are jumping to conclusions about a coverup that doesn't exist Through an attorney, family of Freddie Gray says there is no way he injured himself (CNN) The investigation into the death of Freddie Gray is now in the hands of the state attorney general for the city of Baltimore. But those seeking answers will be waiting for a while. Unappeased, the protests will continue in Baltimore and elsewhere -- especially since it's May Day on Friday -- the international day of protest for the rights of the working class. Late Thursday, protests wound down peacefully in Baltimore as a 10 p.m. curfew took effect, but near a CVS store that had burned out in previous rioting, a body was found in a semi truck. Police have not identified the body nor said whether the death had any connection to this weeks' mayhem. An Illinois-based trucking company said that a driver hailing from Baltimore was reported missing by his family after visiting home. He did not appear back to work as scheduled on Wednesday. In Philadelphia, Freddie Gray protesters clashed with police on Thursday, when officers tried to prevent protesters from blocking a highway. The winding mystery While Maryland's attorney general's office expects an autopsy report from the medical examiner's office in the coming days, the mystery of how the 25-year-old died has grown more complex. On Thursday, three new accounts surfaced on how and where he sustained the severe spine injury that lead to his death. One indicated that it may have been during his apprehension on April 12; the other two reported that it may have occurred during the paddy wagon ride to the police station. There, an ambulance was called, and Gray was taken to a hospital where he died a week later. Also, police revealed the van had made an additional stop that was recorded by a privately owned video camera, arousing suspicion among protesters, who wondered why it was not previously mentioned. In Philadelphia, supporters of Baltimore protests take to the streets Was it in the van? Gray may have been mortally injured in the van, according to a report by CNN affiliate WJLA in Washington. The police investigation did not find he died from injuries caused during his arrest, the station reported, citing \"multiple law enforcement sources briefed on the police findings.\" Gray slammed into part of the police van, which apparently broke his neck, the investigation found. A head injury matches up to a bolt in the van, the report said, which did not mention how the injury may have happened. An official in the state's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner wouldn't comment to CNN on the report, citing the ongoing investigation. Police have said that Gray had not been properly fastened into the van. Was it self-inflicted injury? Gray may have inflicted the injuries upon himself, according to a second report, which cited a police account taken from an additional prisoner the paddy wagon picked up after Gray. The prisoner told investigators he thought Gray \"was intentionally trying to injure himself,\" according to the Washington Post, citing a Baltimore police investigation document. JUST WATCHED ",

It's a fight that has been years in the making. Finally Floyd \"Money\" Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao will go head-to-head on Saturday. Here's a look at the numbers behind the boxers: 60:40 -- revenue split in favor of Mayweather. $300-400m -- the estimated total revenue for the May 2 bout. 38 -- Mayweather's age; two years older than his opponent. 5 -- The number of years it took to strike a deal between the two boxers. $1.5m -- How much Pacquiao's shorts alone will be worth after six companies bid for sponsorship space. $25,000 -- The value of the mouth guard adorned with diamonds and gold Mayweather will wear on fight night. $1,500 -- starting price for tickets in U.S. dollars. 8 -- Pacquiao is the first and only eight-division world champion with 10 world titles to his name. 1 -- Mayweather's ranking on last year's Forbes highest-paid athletes list . $105m -- The amount \"Money\" earned last year. $180,000 -- T he price ringside tickets had skyrocketed to by April 27 (5 days before the fight.) 16,800 -- Capacity at the MGM Grand Garden arena where the fight will take place. 5 -- The number of boxers Pacquiao and Mayweather have both fought. The \"famous five\": Juan Manuel Marquez, Ricky Hatton, Oscar De La Hoya, Shane Mosley and Miguel Cotto. $100 -- The fee pay-per-view subscribers will shell out to watch the fight, which will be aired jointly on Showtime and HBO. $300m -- Expected pay-per-view buys with the most sales coming from U.S., Puerto Rican and Canadian markets, according to Repucom. $5.6m -- The winning bid for official fight sponsorship by Tecate beer. 57 -- The number of wins throughout Pacquiao's career. Mayweather has less at 47 wins, but... 0 -- Mayweather remains undefeated in his fight career (Pacquiao, on the other hand, has suffered 5 losses.) Meanwhile Floyd Mayweather has told fans to be ready for an epic battle when he faces Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on Saturday. With the time for talking all but done -- the weigh-ins take place at 11pm BST on Friday -- the 38-year-old American told CNN: \"He's going to come and bring his best -- and his best is going to bring the best out of me. \"My job is to go out there and be Floyd Mayweather and do what I do best. Both sides have said a lot, but it's all about the two competitors.\" Unbeaten in 47 professional fights, Mayweather played down claims from some quarters that he had appeared subdued in the build-up to what some are calling the \"Fight of the Century.\" \"I feel good,\" he said. \"I'm very, very happy. My team have done a tremendous job. \"I have grown and matured over the years. I'm not far from 40 years old, and I have been in this sport as a professional for 19 years. You outgrow some things. \"I know I can fight, and I know the guy I am fighting. It is not an easy task, but this is my job. This is what I chose to do.\" 450,000 Bottles of Dom Perignon?How would you spend $180M? @cnnsport @CNNMoney http://t.co/M5kgYc1HDk pic.twitter.com/NWc74VkKnG â Coy Wire (@CoyWire) April 29, 2015 Pacquiao said he was \"ready for the challenge\" and had \"peace of mind.\" But the 36-year-old Filipino southpaw admitted that his 65th -- and most eagerly-awaited -- professional fight would be \"different,\" adding: \"I'm excited, and I'm sure the fans will love it. \"It means a lot to me to be representing the Philippines -- people are excited to watch this fight. \"I don't have a prediction, but I will do my best to make the fans happy. They deserve a good fight. They are paying more than double than for a regular fight.\" Getting a ticket for the MGM Grand has proven to be a difficult and massively expensive undertaking, with the price of a ringside seat rocketing. As Mayweather put it: \"Tickets are going for between $8,000 and $400,000 to $500,000. You know, we call this the billionaire boys' club.\" But plenty have stumped up big bucks to be there, with Tony Buzbee, an attorney who paid $74,000 for a pair of 12th-row seats, telling CNN: \"It's going to be a once in a lifetime type of fight, and I'm going to be there just for the event of it all. \"Growing up loving sports, to be in a position where I can go to this type of event... it's just wonderful.\" Pacquiao fan Mark Sarmiento, who paid $7,500 to be there, agrees. \"It was a little out of budget but once I got it, it sunk in -- I'm pretty much going to this fight,\" he said.",

      "text": "A woman is comforted during the protest on April 22. Hide Caption 56 of 56 EXPAND GALLERY Mosby, 35, who comes from a long line of police officers, including her grandfather, four uncles and her mother, assumes a key role in the latest case to draw national attention to the issue of relations between police officers and the communities they are sworn to serve. \"My grandfather was one of the first African-American police officers in Massachusetts and one of the things he instilled on us is the importance of public service,\" Mosby said in a campaign video. Marilyn Mosby comes from a long line of police officers, including her grandfather, four uncles and her mother. Freddie Gray's mysterious death has turned the largely black city near the nation's capital into a tinderbox where mostly peaceful demonstrations on Monday erupted in pockets of looting and rioting in the hours after Gray's funeral. A 10 p.m. citywide curfew was put into effect two days ago, and National Guard troops have joined Baltimore police in an attempt to maintain order. On Thursday, as police handed their investigative files over to the state attorney's officer a day earlier than planned, supporters of the former insurance company lawyer expressed confidence in Mosby's ability to handle the volatile case. What we know, don't know about Freddie Gray's arrest 'We have much more confidence in her' \"We're enthusiastic about the new prosecutor,\" said William \"Billy\" Murphy Jr., a former Baltimore judge who is now the lead attorney for Gray's family. \"She comes to the office with a belief in the integrity of these kinds of investigations. We have much more confidence in her than we have in the police because there's never been any level of confidence, nor should there be, in the police investigating themselves.\" Mosby confirmed in a statement Thursday that she had received the police's investigative report. She said that while police have regularly briefed her office on their findings, her team has been conducting its own independent probe into the April 19 death. 45 CVS workers still getting paid after riots shut down stores \"While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings, but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,\" Mosby said. \"We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.\" Mosby is married to Baltimore City Councilman Nick Mosby, who represents areas of West Baltimore where riots erupted earlier this week. The couple have two young daughters. \"She's my wife,\" Nick Mosby told CNN on Thursday. \"She's a strong woman. She was built for this ... I was at church service the other day and they were talking about being at the right place with the right person at the right time. I know her heart has always been convicted to ensure that justice will be served fairly and equally across the board.\" Cousin's death brought exposure to criminal justice system During her campaign, Mosby spoke about the broad daylight shooting death of her 17-year-old cousin on her front doorstep. \"I learned very early on that the criminal justice system isn't just the police, the judges and the state's attorney,\" she said. \"It's much more than that. I believe that we are the justice system. We, the members of the community, are the justice system because we are the victims of crimes.\" Mosby said her cousin's 1994 murder was her first introduction to the criminal justice system. \"Having to go to court and deal with prosecutors,\" she said. \"Having to go to court and see my neighbor who had the courage and audacity to cooperate with the police ... to testify in court and the way the district attorney's office treated my family is something that inspired me.\" Mosby, who grew up in Boston, is the youngest chief prosecutor of any major city in the United States, according to the state's attorney's website. At the age of 6, Mosby was accepted in a school desegregation program in Massachusetts. She later participated in a study of the civil rights movement. \"After having that awesome experience I knew I wanted to be an attorney,\" she said during her campaign. A. Dwight Pettit, a civil rights attorney and Mosby supporter, said he believes she will \"deliver on doing it right, and getting it right. I'm confident in that.\" \"She's very dedicated and part of what she campaigned on was bringing integrity to the office, and so I believe that she will move in a methodical way,\" he said. \"And I think that she will follow where the evidence leads. I do not think she will follow just public opinion.\" Prosecutor said it's time to rebuild trust When she was sworn in as chief prosecutor earlier this year, Mosby brought up the lack of trust between the community and police. \"Our time to repair that trust, to come together collectively as a community to start to break down the barriers to progress in our communities is now,\" she said. Mosby added, \"As a black woman who understands just how much the criminal justice system disproportionately affects communities of color, I will seek justice on your behalf.\" Mosby is African-American, as are Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts and other leading Baltimore officials. Although about 63% of Baltimore's population is black, they face stunning disparities when it comes to income, employment, poverty, housing, incarceration and overall health. The people on Mosby's transition team included former Mayor Kurt Schmoke, former congressman and NAACP president Kweisi Mfume and Murphy, who is now representing Gray's family. Schmoke, a former state's attorney and Baltimore's first African-American mayor, said Mosby's background will buy her time with a tense community anxious for justice. \"I actually think that the level of patience will actually increase primarily because the state's attorney, Marilyn Mosby, was recently elected,\" he said. \"She has a level of credibility with the community that will allow for that patience. I can't say how long, but I do think that people will give her a little bit more time to do it right rather than to do it fast.\" Mosby defeated Gregg Bernstein as state's attorney in a 2014 election. \"Baltimore prosecutors get to see it all in court -- we've got the toughest job in America,\" she said in a statement after the election. Mary Koch, another attorney for Gray's family, said the new chief prosecutor has her work cut out for her. \"The family wants the truth and they want it to be arrived at very carefully and that's not going to be an easy job for Ms. Mosby,\" said Koch, adding: \"That's her job. That's the job she took on.\" ",

      "text": "Tracking the van carrying Freddie Gray 02:49 Story highlights Donta Allen says he overheard an officer say, \"Well, you know, we gave him a run for his money -- he's not breathing\" Allen was in the police van with Gray during part of the van's meandering course to the police station \"I know for a fact that he did not hurt himself,\" says Allen Don Lemon's interview with Donta Allen airs Friday on \"CNN Tonight,\" at 10 p.m. ET (CNN) The man who rode in a police van with Freddie Gray -- separated only by a partition -- is adamant about two things: \"I know for a fact that he (Gray) did not hurt himself,\" Donta Allen, who was a fellow prisoner in the van during a portion of the meandering path of the vehicle after Gray was taken into the custody and before medical help was summoned, told CNN's Don Lemon in an interview. Reciting a litany of Gray's injuries, Allen added \"you cannot do that (to yourself) in the paddy wagon. You can probably hit your head and have a little headache, but you can't hurt yourself to the point you're going to be dead.\" And as for a report in the Washington Post that he told investigators he had heard noises indicating Gray was trying to injure himself, \"untrue. Very, very, very untrue,\" said Allen. During the interview, airing Friday on \"CNN Tonight,\" Allen said at the police station, as he was being taken to the \"bullpen\" area for incoming prisoners, he overheard a female police officer say, \"Well, you know, we gave him a run for his money -- he's not breathing.\" \"I don't know who, but I heard police saying that,\" Allen told Lemon. \"They weren't saying it like, 'Guys, we really have a problem here.'\" As he was waiting in the bullpen, Allen said, \"An officer lady came in and she's like, 'Well, he's got vitals now.'\" Police have not discussed specifics of what took place at the police station. On Friday, six police officers were charged in Gray's death. Michael Davey, an attorney for the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police who spoke on behalf of the six officers and their attorneys, told reporters Friday that none of the officers injured or harmed Gray. \"They are truly saddened by his death,\" Davey said. \"These officers did nothing wrong.\" Gray died on April 19 after suffering a spinal injury while in police custody a week before. His death sparked protests against police in Baltimore, which later spread to major cities nationwide. Court documents said Gray was arrested after running away from the police. Allen said that during the time he was in the van, which was near the end of the course taken by the van after Gray was picked up, he had no idea who was on the other side of the partition. He said he had known Gray from the neighborhood, but only by his first name. \"I never see who's in the van,\" Allen said. \"They (police) never tell me somebody else is in the van.\" The only sound he heard from the other side, Allen remembered, was \"a little banging, like someone was over there banging their head or something.\" His portion of the ride was smooth, Allen said. \"No stops, we went straight to the police station.\" Allen said he was in custody after being accosted by officers as he was leaving a store empty-handed. He said he was searched, officers found a small amount of marijuana on him, and called for the police transport van. At the police station, he was questioned by a homicide investigator with general questions about crimes that had happened in the area, then he was released without explanation, Allen said. \"They never booked me, never charged me.\" Asked by Lemon if he was afraid now, Allen said, \"I'm telling the truth and I know they don't want me to tell the truth. \"I know they're gonna try to harass me after this. But I'd rather for them to harass me than my own people to harass me for a lie they made up.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> More from US ",

      "text": "Freddie Gray suffered fatal spinal injury while being transported in police van, prosecutor says Six police officers are charged in Gray's death Watch a special report, \"Police Under Fire,\" Monday at 9 p.m. ET/PT. (CNN) In publicly outlining her case against six police officers in the death of Freddie Gray, Baltimore's chief prosecutor faulted what they did -- and did not do. Among the allegations: Failure to find probable cause, illegal arrest, failure to seek or render medical aid, gross negligence and misconduct. \"The findings of our comprehensive, thorough and independent investigation coupled with the medical examiner's determination that Mr. Gray's death was a homicide ... has led us to believe that we have probable cause to file criminal charges,\" State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby told reporters from the broad steps of the downtown War Memorial. Gray suffered a fatal spinal injury on April 12 while being transported \"handcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained\" in a police van, Mosby said. Michael Davey, an attorney for the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police who spoke on behalf of the six officers and their attorneys, told reporters that none of the officers injured or harmed Gray. \"They are truly saddened by his death,\" Davey said. \"These officers did nothing wrong.\" These are the actions that Mosby said resulted in the charges against the six , based on the statement of probable cause: Officer Garrett E. Miller Miller, 26, who joined the force in 2012, was one of three officers on bike patrol on the morning of April 12 in Baltimore. One of the other officers made eye contact with Gray, who began running. Gray eventually surrendered and was handcuffed. He was \"placed in a prone position with his arms handcuffed behind his back. It was at this time that Mr. Gray indicated that he could not breathe and requested an inhaler to no avail,\" Mosby said. Officer Garrett E. Miller Miller and another officer placed Gray in a seated position. They found a knife in his pants pocket. The blade of the knife was folded into the handle. It was not a switchblade, and legal to carry under Maryland law. \"Mr. Gray was placed back down on his stomach at which time Mr. Gray began to flail his legs and scream as Officer Miller placed Mr. Gray in a restraining technique known as a leg lace,\" the prosecutor said. The three officers failed to establish probable cause for Gray's arrest. No crime had been committed. The arrest was illegal, Mosby said. When the police van arrived, Miller and the two other officers loaded Gray into the wagon. At no point was Gray secured by a seat belt as is required. A while later, at Baker Street, Miller and the officers removed Gray from the wagon, placed handcuffs on his wrists and leg shackles on his ankles. They completed paperwork before loading Gray back into the wagon. He was placed on his stomach headfirst on the floor. Miller is charged with two counts of second-degree assault, two counts of misconduct in office and false imprisonment. Lt. Brian W. Rice Rice, 41, an officer since 1997, was one of the officers on bike patrol during the initial encounter with Gray. He made eye contact with Gray, who then ran. Rice and others failed to establish probable cause for Gray's illegal arrest. Later, Rice and two other officers handcuffed Gray and put shackles on his ankles. The officers placed Gray back on the floor of the wagon, face down. Lt. Brian W. Rice Rice is charged with involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault, two counts of misconduct in office and false imprisonment. Separately, records from the Carroll County, Maryland, Sheriff's Department show that Rice was taken to a hospital in 2012 because of concerns about his mental health. The concerns were raised by another officer who is also the mother of Rice's child, according to the records. At the time, deputies confiscated Rice's guns and alerted his superiors in Baltimore. The records show that Rice said he \"could not continue to go on like this\" and threatened to do something in his laundry room if the mother of his child \"did not come over to his residence.\" His specific threat was redacted from the documents. It's unclear how long Rice was at the hospital. Rice could not be reached for comment. Officer Edward M. Nero Officer Edward M. Nero Nero, 29, on the job since 2012, was the third officer on bike patrol when Gray was arrested. Mosby said Nero held Gray down until the wagon arrived. Along with Rice and Miller, Nero failed to establish probable cause for what Mosby called an illegal arrest. Nero also assisted Rice and Miller later in cuffing and shackling Gray. He is charged with two counts of second-degree assault, two counts of misconduct in office and false imprisonment. Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr. Goodson, 45, who joined the police department in 1999, drove the transport wagon. He had been directed to deliver Gray to the central booking facility. At one point, Goodson parked the van to check on his prisoner. Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr. \"Despite stopping for the purpose of checking on Mr. Gray's condition, at no point did he seek nor did he render any medical assistance for Mr. Gray,\" Mosby said. Goodson returned to the driver's seat and headed toward central booking with Gray still unsecured. After several blocks, the officer called dispatch to say he needed to check on his prisoner. He requested additional units. Another officer arrived and, with Goodson, went to the back of the wagon. Gray requested help and said he could not breathe. One officer asked Gray if he needed a medic. Twice, Gray said he needed medical assistance. The officer helped lift Gray from the floor to a bench in the van. Again, the officers failed to restrain Gray or request medical assistance. Goodson then responded to a separate call for assistance in an arrest. \"Despite Mr. Gray's obvious and recognized need for medical assistance, Officer Goodson in a grossly negligent manner chose to respond ... with Gray still unsecured by a seat belt in the wagon, without rendering or summoning medical assistance,\" Mosby said. At the next stop, Goodson was met by Miller and three other officers. He walked to the back of the wagon to check on Gray. Goodson and the other officers saw that Gray was unresponsive. Still, Goodson picked up a new prisoner and drove to a police station to drop him off. He failed to restrain Gray for at least the fifth time, Mosby said. Gray was no longer breathing. Goodson is charged with second-degree depraved-heart murder, involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault, two counts of manslaughter by vehicle and misconduct in office. CNN legal analyst Sonny Hostin said the depraved-heart murder charge appeared to indicate the prosecutor believes Goodson was \"one of the worst actors\" in Gray's death. \"Depraved heart means he intentionally, willfully and deliberately acted with depraved indifference to human life,\" she said. Sgt. Alicia D. White White, 30, an officer since 2010, was present during one of the stops to check on Gray's condition. White and two other officers saw that Gray was unresponsive on the floor of the wagon. White, who was responsible for investigating two citizen complaints related to Gray's arrest, spoke to the back of the prisoner's head. Sgt. Alicia D. White When Gray did not respond, White allegedly did nothing. She had been advised that Gray needed a medic but made no effort to assess his condition. \"Despite Mr. Gray's seriously deteriorating medical condition, no medical assistance was rendered or summoned for Mr. Gray at that time by any officer,\" Mosby said. Later, White and two other officers attempted to remove Gray from the wagon. He was no longer breathing. A medic later determined Gray was in \"cardiac arrest and ... critically and severely injured.\" Gray was rushed to the University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center, where he underwent surgery. On April 19, he was pronounced dead from his injuries. \"The manner of death, deemed a homicide by the Maryland State Medical Examiner, is believed to be the result of a fatal injury that occurred while Mr. Gray was unrestrained by a seat belt in the custody of the Baltimore Police Department wagon,\" Mosby said. White is charged with involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault and misconduct in office. Officer William G. Porter Officer William G. Porter Porter, 25, who joined the force in 2012, responded when Goodson asked for additional units to check on Gray. The prisoner told Porter he could not breathe. Porter asked Gray if he needed a medic. Gray said \"yes\" twice. The officer helped lift Gray to a bench but did not assess his condition or call for medical assistance. Porter also was present later when Goodson picked up another prisoner, and White and others discovered that Gray was unresponsive. Porter is charged with involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault and misconduct in office.

      "text": "Freddie Gray's stepfather: Charges an important step toward justice The six officers have a preliminary hearing on May 27 Watch a CNN special report, \"Police Under Fire,\" at 9 p.m. ET/PT Monday. Baltimore (CNN) After a day of jubilation following charges against six Baltimore police officers in the death of Freddie Gray, protesters cleared the streets early Saturday to observe a curfew. A few protesters scuffled with police after 10 p.m., when the curfew went into effect, leading to some arrests. Authorities used a megaphone from a helicopter to warn protesters to go home or get arrested. By midnight, the streets were deserted as a hush washed over the city, a far cry from the boisterous honking, weeping and cheers earlier when the city's top prosecutor announced charges. Six officers to face charges Six police officers will face charges in the death of Gray, Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said Friday, describing what she believes happened April 12, when Gray was arrested. The 25-year-old died after suffering \"a severe and critical neck injury\" while being transported \"handcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained\" inside a police van, she said. It is against police policy to transport a prisoner without proper restraints such as a seat belt. Police union 'frustrated' The police union called for an independent prosecutor, saying Mosby has conflicts of interests. They also criticized her for not waiting until police were done with their inquiry. \"Let me begin by stating how appalled and frustrated we are at this morning's events. .... We are disappointed in the apparent rush to judgment given the fact that the investigation into this matter has not been concluded,\" said Gene Ryan, president of the police union. \"Our officers, like every other American, are entitled to due process.\" The Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police said the officers did nothing wrong. \"No officer injured Mr. Gray, caused harm to Mr. Gray, and they are truly saddened by his death,\" said Michael Davey, an attorney for the union. The accused The officers face various charges that could bring more than 10 years in prison. â¢ Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr., 45, faces one count of second-degree depraved-heart murder, involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault, manslaughter by vehicle (gross negligence), manslaughter by vehicle (criminal negligence) and misconduct in office. â¢ Lt. Brian W. Rice, 41, faces one count of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second-degree assault, two counts of misconduct in office and one count of false imprisonment. â¢ Sgt. Alicia D. White, 30, faces one count of involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault and misconduct in office. â¢ Officer William G. Porter, 25, faces one count of involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault and misconduct in office. â¢ Officer Garrett E. Miller, 26, faces two counts of second-degree assault, two counts of misconduct in office and one count of false imprisonment. â¢ Officer Edward M. Nero, 29, faces two counts of second-degree assault, two counts of misconduct in office and one count of false imprisonment. Second-degree depraved-heart murder is punishable by up to 30 years in prison. Gray's relatives said they are satisfied with the charges announced. \"These charges are an important step in getting justice for Freddie,\" said his stepfather, Richard Shipley.

      "text": "Brazil extends 'deepest sympathy' to family of executed Brazilian Indonesia executed eight death row inmates early Wednesday Australian PM calls executions \"cruel and unnecessary\" (CNN) Australia has recalled its ambassador to Indonesia for consultations after two Australians were among eight drug smugglers executed by firing squad early Wednesday. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott called the executions \"cruel and unnecessary\" because both men, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, had been \"fully rehabilitated\" during a decade in prison. Abbott didn't say what permanent actions, if any, would be taken against Indonesia. \"This is a dark moment in the relationship, but I'm sure the relationship will be restored,\" he said. One of the men's Indonesian lawyers, Todung Mulya Lubis tweeted his apologies. \"I failed. I lost,\" he said. \"I'm sorry.\" \nI failed. I lost. â Todung Mulya Lubis (@TodungLubis) April 28, 2015 Indonesian President Joko Widodo appeared to shrug off the diplomatic recall, telling reporters that \"our legal sovereignty must be respected. We also respect other countries' legal sovereignty.\" Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said the country had no plans to recall its own ambassador in response. \"This is a legal case. This is not a political case so at this very stage, we do not have any plan to call our ambassador back from Canberra,\" he said. READ: Why Australians are angry Six other inmates were executed, including Nigerians Raheem Salami, Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise, Okwudil Oyatanze and Martin Anderson; Indonesian Zainal Abidin and Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte, who was said to be mentally ill. On Wednesday, Brazil's foreign ministry released a statement expressing \"deep sadness\" at Gularte's execution, saying that Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff had urged her Indonesian counterpart to spare him due to his \"psychiatric condition.\" Gularte is the second Brazilian to be executed in Indonesia this year, with the first -- Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira -- prompting the country to recall its ambassador for consultations. Filipina spared The Indonesian government had originally announced that nine prisoners would be executed, bu t at the last moment Filipina Mary Jane Veloso was spared . \"We are so happy, so happy. I thought I had lost my daughter already but God is so good. Thank you to everyone who helped us,\" her mother Celia Veloso told CNN. Philippines embassy officials said Veloso would be returned to Yogyakarta prison in Central Java later on Wednesday. Filipina death row prisoner Mary Jane Veloso seen in traditional dress to mark Kartini Day at Yogyakarta prison, April 21, 2015. No reason was given for the reprieve but it may relate to developments in her case late on Tuesday. CNN Philippines reported that Veloso's alleged recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio and her partner Julius Lacanilao, surrendered to authorities. The report said Sergio had denied all accusations in relation to Veloso's case. Veloso's lawyers claimed the mother-of-two was the victim of human trafficking. They say she was offered work in Malaysia, but when she arrived she was told the job had been filled and wasn't aware the bag she'd been given for the return journey to Indonesia was filled with drugs. A tenth prisoner, Frenchman Serge Atlaoui, was also scheduled to be executed but his case was delayed while a court considers a legal challenge. No reprieve for Australians Candlelight vigils were held for Chan and Sukumaran in the hours ahead of the expected execution.The men's legal teams had been fighting for years for a stay, but it wasn't to be. The men -- then aged in their early twenties -- were arrested in 2005 as part of the \"Bali Nine,\" a drug smuggling gang that intended to import 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) of heroin from Bali to Australia. They failed.

Hide Caption EXPAND GALLERY Displacing uncle Harry The newest addition will be fourth-in-line to the throne, bumping William's brother, Prince Harry, to fifth place. Prince Harry's ascension to the throne was a long shot, anyway. The second child of royal parents is known as \"spare heir.\" Traditionally, they were expected to rule if an older sibling died or could not become king or queen. While the older brother or sister is destined for a life of regal duty and obligation -- of public engagements, investitures and ribbon cutting ceremonies -- the role of the younger royal is less defined. Break from tradition William was born in a private wing at the same hospital on June 21, 1982. So was George. While that might seem normal to most in his generation, it is a break with tradition. Before William, all heirs to the throne had been born at home or at the home of a royal family member. William's father, Prince Charles, was born at Buckingham Palace. Big question When George was born, William and Catherine opted to use the shorter version of his name.The chubby-cheeked toddler's official name is Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge. George and his new baby sister may use \"Cambridge\" as a last name when they attend school in a few years. But one big question remains: What will the royals name the new princess? CNN's Elaine Ly contributed from London, and Faith Karimi wrote and reported from Atlanta. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report. The British Royal Family",

By contrast, the fastest train in the United States, Amtrak's Acela Express, is only capable of 241 kilometers per hour (150 miles per hour), though it usually plods along at half that speed. Look ma, no tracks! Unlike traditional trains, maglev trains work by using magnets to push the train away from the tracks and drive the train forward. A Japanese maglev train during a test run. Japan's maglevs don't use metal tracks â instead, they float nearly 10 cm (4 inches) above special guideways, allowing for frictionless movement. Japan Railways has been testing their train to figure out the best operational speed for a planned route between Tokyo and Nagoya, scheduled to begin service in 2027. That trip can take nearly 5 hours by car. But in the future, a maglev train could finish the journey in 40 minutes.

It's a fight that has been years in the making. Finally Floyd \"Money\" Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao will go head-to-head on Saturday. Here's a look at the numbers behind the boxers: 60:40 -- revenue split in favor of Mayweather. $300-400m -- the estimated total revenue for the May 2 bout. 38 -- Mayweather's age; two years older than his opponent. 5 -- The number of years it took to strike a deal between the two boxers. $1.5m -- How much Pacquiao's shorts alone will be worth after six companies bid for sponsorship space. $25,000 -- The value of the mouth guard adorned with diamonds and gold Mayweather will wear on fight night. $1,500 -- starting price for tickets in U.S. dollars. 8 -- Pacquiao is the first and only eight-division world champion with 10 world titles to his name. 1 -- Mayweather's ranking on last year's Forbes highest-paid athletes list . $105m -- The amount \"Money\" earned last year. $180,000 -- T he price ringside tickets had skyrocketed to by April 27 (5 days before the fight.) 16,800 -- Capacity at the MGM Grand Garden arena where the fight will take place. 5 -- The number of boxers Pacquiao and Mayweather have both fought. The \"famous five\": Juan Manuel Marquez, Ricky Hatton, Oscar De La Hoya, Shane Mosley and Miguel Cotto. $100 -- The fee pay-per-view subscribers will shell out to watch the fight, which will be aired jointly on Showtime and HBO. $300m -- Expected pay-per-view buys with the most sales coming from U.S., Puerto Rican and Canadian markets, according to Repucom. $5.6m -- The winning bid for official fight sponsorship by Tecate beer. 57 -- The number of wins throughout Pacquiao's career. Mayweather has less at 47 wins, but... 0 -- Mayweather remains undefeated in his fight career (Pacquiao, on the other hand, has suffered 5 losses.) Meanwhile Floyd Mayweather has told fans to be ready for an epic battle when he faces Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on Saturday. With the time for talking all but done -- the weigh-ins take place at 11pm BST on Friday -- the 38-year-old American told CNN: \"He's going to come and bring his best -- and his best is going to bring the best out of me. \"My job is to go out there and be Floyd Mayweather and do what I do best. Both sides have said a lot, but it's all about the two competitors.\" Unbeaten in 47 professional fights, Mayweather played down claims from some quarters that he had appeared subdued in the build-up to what some are calling the \"Fight of the Century.\" \"I feel good,\" he said. \"I'm very, very happy. My team have done a tremendous job. \"I have grown and matured over the years. I'm not far from 40 years old, and I have been in this sport as a professional for 19 years. You outgrow some things. \"I know I can fight, and I know the guy I am fighting. It is not an easy task, but this is my job. This is what I chose to do.\" 450,000 Bottles of Dom Perignon?How would you spend $180M? @cnnsport @CNNMoney http://t.co/M5kgYc1HDk pic.twitter.com/NWc74VkKnG â Coy Wire (@CoyWire) April 29, 2015 Pacquiao said he was \"ready for the challenge\" and had \"peace of mind.\" But the 36-year-old Filipino southpaw admitted that his 65th -- and most eagerly-awaited -- professional fight would be \"different,\" adding: \"I'm excited, and I'm sure the fans will love it. \"It means a lot to me to be representing the Philippines -- people are excited to watch this fight. \"I don't have a prediction, but I will do my best to make the fans happy. They deserve a good fight. They are paying more than double than for a regular fight.\" Getting a ticket for the MGM Grand has proven to be a difficult and massively expensive undertaking, with the price of a ringside seat rocketing. As Mayweather put it: \"Tickets are going for between $8,000 and $400,000 to $500,000. You know, we call this the billionaire boys' club.\" But plenty have stumped up big bucks to be there, with Tony Buzbee, an attorney who paid $74,000 for a pair of 12th-row seats, telling CNN: \"It's going to be a once in a lifetime type of fight, and I'm going to be there just for the event of it all. \"Growing up loving sports, to be in a position where I can go to this type of event... it's just wonderful.\" Pacquiao fan Mark Sarmiento, who paid $7,500 to be there, agrees. \"It was a little out of budget but once I got it, it sunk in -- I'm pretty much going to this fight,\" he said.",

Hide Caption 25 of 25 EXPAND GALLERY In Pacquiao's homeland of the Philippines, millions tuned in to watch their hero, congressman and cultural icon take on the man known to refer to himself as \"TBE\" (The Best Ever.) Yet for all his talk of being better than Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard, there was something different about Mayweather before this fight. His usual trash talk and brash outspokenness was noticeably absent. Some said it was uncharacteristic nerves, others extreme focus on his biggest ever challenge. Some even wondered whether Mayweather was displaying a new-found maturity. At the ripe old age of 38, could that really be? This, after all, is the man who once waved around a chicken with a fake gold medal round its neck to mock Olympic gold medal winner, Oscar De La Hoya, when the pair met in what was previously the most lucrative bout of all time in 2007. Ready to rumble The way the fight began Saturday, it looked like those predicting a supremely focused Mayweather were correct. Floyd Mayweather Jr. throws a left at Manny Pacquiao. The 10-time world champion and the larger man, sought to establish his dominance early, using his jab to keep the powerful Pacquiao at a distance while landing with two large right hands early on. But Pacquiao was the aggressor at the beginning of round two. The Filipino moved forward more although he still found it difficult to make contact with the ever elusive Mayweather. Earlier in the week, former middleweight world champion Bernard \"The Executioner\" Hopkins described Mayweather's defensive style as like a turtle going into its shell. \"You can beat that shell up but you're not hurting him.\" Like the wily tortoise up against the hare, the man with the impenetrable shell looked to be in control. Round three offered much of the same but Pacquiao finally began to land in round four, pushing Mayweather against the ropes and letting rip with a sequence of blows to the body. Mayweather fought back in five and six, reasserting his control although Pacquiao twice caught him with his dangerous left hand. Trainer Freddie Roach adjust Manny Pacquiao's mouthguard. By the eighth, the fight had become a chess match. Mayweather moved and picked his opponent off with the jab. Pacquiao was only landing with 18% of his punches, far fewer than his usual average of 34%. When the 10th arrived the cocky Mayweather was back, smiling and dropping his hands to taunt an increasingly frustrated Pacquiao. The Pacquiao corner knew a knockout was required but their man had to catch his fleet-footed opponent in the opposite corner first. Alas, it was a task the crowd favorite could not rise to, although the fighter himself felt he had done enough to claim victory. \"I thought I won,\" Pacquiao said in the ring post fight. \"He didn't do nothing, just moved outside. I got him many times.\" Floyd Mayweather Jr. celebrates victory after the MGM clash. \"He is moving around and it's not easy to throw a lot of punches if your opponent moves around. I can handle his power, it's not strong like other opponents. It's not about size. I've been fighting bigger than him and it's not a problem.\" Understandably, the victorious Mayweather -- as well as most ring-side observers -- disagreed. \"I was a smart fighter, I out-boxed him,\" said Mayweather, shaking off boos from the crowd which was unimpressed with his defensive style. \"We did what we had to do tonight. I knew he was going to push me. He had moments in the fight but I kept him on the outside.\" \"He's a hell of a fighter. Now I see why he is one of the guys at the pinnacle of the sport of boxing.\" ",

      "text": "What it's like to shop for the Apple Watch Your mother hates your tattoos. So does your Apple Watch, apparently. \nTattooed wrists can prevent the Apple Watch's heart rate sensor from functioning properly, according to some customers. \nSince the Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) Watch uses your heart rate to determine whether you're wearing it, you might not be able to use Apple Pay, receive notifications, place calls, or use certain apps if you have tattoos on your wrists. \nSome Apple Watch wearers on Reddit and Twitter complained about the tattoo issue, and Apple blog iMore confirmed that the problem exists. \nThe issue stems from the way that the Apple Watch senses your heartbeat. According to Apple , the back of the Watch rapidly flashes green and infrared light at your skin, which gets absorbed or reflected by your red blood. When your heart beats, there is more blood in your wrist, and there is less blood between beats. By sensing the timing between your heartbeats, the Apple Watch can calculate your heart rate. \nAs it turns out, solid-colored tattoos -- particularly red ones -- also absorb the green light and reflect red light. Black tattoos, which absorb both green and red light, can also screw up the Apple Watch's heart rate sensor. Reddit user guinne55fan complained that his wrist tattoos interfered with the Apple Watch's sensor. \nThe Apple Watch works fine with dark-colored skin, scars and skin abrasions, which are translucent, allowing light to pass through. Tattoo ink is opaque, preventing outside light from penetrating your skin. \nOne Reddit user found that he could turn off the Apple Watch's wrist detection, allowing notifications to come in. But he couldn't use Apple Pay or receive calls without the wrist detection setting turned on. \nA spokeswoman from Apple did not respond to a request for comment. ",
