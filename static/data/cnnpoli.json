      "text": "Obama: 'It is a good deal' 02:23 Story highlights Frida Ghitis: President Barack Obama is right to want a deal, but this one gives Iran too much She says the framework agreement starts lifting Iran sanctions much too soon Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) President Barack Obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with Iran even before he became the Democratic candidate for president. Reaching a good, solid agreement with Iran is a worthy, desirable goal. But the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations, weakening America's hand and strengthening Iran. Obama's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with Iran that if the deal ultimately collapses, he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it. There is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the United States and not Iran that is the more eager, even desperate, side in these talks, even though Iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions; the country whose only significant export, oil, lost more than half of its value in recent months. The reason is that Obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations. The President may insist that the United States will choose no deal over a bad deal, but few people truly believe he has a credible Plan B. Few believe it, particularly in the Middle East and notably among America's Arab friends, who hold the view that Iran is running circles around the United States and outplayed Obama. As the writer David Rothkopf aptly put it , \"Iran is having a great Obama administration.\" That's a belief that has already started shaking up the region. Saudi Arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes Iran has not been stopped, and there is little doubt that other countries among Iran's Muslim rivals will do the same. In fact, the notion that Obama is not handling the Iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and other Arabs are trying to push back against gains by Iran's allies. We can trace it all back to the Democratic primaries in 2007, when then-Sen. Obama said he would meet Iran's leaders \"without preconditions,\" leading his rival, Hillary Clinton, to call the idea \"Irresponsible and frankly naive.\" As the years of his presidency unfolded, and the Middle East started coming apart, finding a deal with Iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement Obama might leave behind. The political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace. The framework agreement announced on Thursday came two days after Obama's March 31 deadline. The U.S.-imposed deadline served only to pressure the United States, and the French ambassador very publicly decried as a \"bad tactic.\" \n#Iran . Repeating that an agreement has to be reached by the end of March is a bad tactic. Pressure on ourselves to conclude at any price. — Gérard Araud (@GerardAraud) March 20, 2015 That bad tactic was a political move, a push to produce some sort of result, however vague, to protect the talks from critics. Again, a solid agreement that ensures Iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development. But the agreement so far does not look promising. It certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what Obama had vowed. In a presidential debate in 2012, Obama described a crystal clear goal for negotiations. \"The deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program. It's very straightforward.\" Nobody is talking about Iran ending its nuclear program. Not even close. Iran will be allowed to keep one-third of its more than 6,000 centrifuges. That's not a small symbolic number. And it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled, although Fordow will contain no nuclear materials. Iran has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses. The fact is that Iran has a well-established record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to U.N. inspectors. And the U.N. agency chief says that has not stopped. A couple of weeks ago, with days left until the negotiating deadline, U.N. nuclear chief Yukiya Amano said Iran is still stonewalling. \"We are still not in a position to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is [for a] peaceful purpose,\" he warned. The negotiations' starting point is that Iran would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible -- and preferably, forever. The world only learned about Iran's secret facilities at Arak and Natanz after dissidents raised the alarm. Iran, we have learned repeatedly, is very good at lying to international inspectors. It is well-established that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program. It is well-established that many of Iran's neighbors don't trust it and are anxious about the U.S.-led international dealings with Iran. It is well-established that Iran has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region. It is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring Iran to the negotiating table. It was Iran that had the most to lose from a failure of talks. But political considerations turned the United States into the supplicant. The framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon. Nuclear enrichment will continue, although at a lower level. Iran officially, legally, becomes a nuclear threshold state, with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a \"breakout\" period of one year, the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act. Even the Fordow facility, conveniently inside a fortified bunker in a mountain, will remain in existence, though \"converted\" to a nuclear \"research facility\" And without nuclear material on site. International sanctions lifting will begin almost immediately. Its nuclear infrastructure will remain largely in place, even if operating at a reduced pace, giving Iran much of what it wanted. With Iranian forces gaining ground in Arab lands and Iranian commanders declaring the destruction of Israel \"nonnegotiable\" and threatening Saudi Arabia, this deal does not look reassuring. Obama is right that a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option. But the deal so far looks like (another) win for Iran. It introduces enough restrictions that it could give the President the political cover he wants, but it does not do enough to make the world safe from nuclear proliferation and more potentially catastrophic instability in the Middle East.",

BLACKOUT. That's precisely the nightmare scenario one official in the Philippines is hoping to avoid.\nRante Ramos, the board secretary of Palawan Electric Cooperative, is asking residents of his island province to save power during the fight between Philippines native Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather.\n\"Truth is, come May 3, Palawan grid will still be 2-megawatt short of power supply,\" Ramos said in a Facebook post .\n\"But collectively we can do something,\" Ramos said, urging people to unplug as many appliances as they can.\n\"If only 15,000 households would switch off their refrigerators, then the 2-megawatt power deficit is gone. Everybody could have the chance to watch live the fight of the century.\"\nPuerto Princesa, the capital of Palawan, has been suffering daily power outages lasting two to three hours, according to Agence France-Presse.\nWeather forecasts suggest the temperature could reach 94° on fight day, encouraging the use of fans and air conditioning units.\nRelated: Mayweather vs. Pacquiao is the biggest payday in sports\nCNN Philippines, meanwhile, reports that rolling blackouts are affecting some areas of Mindanao, the southernmost major island in the Philippines. Power supply in the south is dependent on aging hydroelectric power plants, and water levels are low this year.\nThe power situation is much less dire in other areas, including Luzon -- the country's most populous island and home to Manila, the capital city.\nEighty-three percent of the Philippines population has access to electricity, according to the World Bank, putting it on a par with countries including South Africa, Sri Lanka and Peru.\nRelated: Floyd Mayweather: The star athlete no sponsor will touch\nCNNMoney (Hong Kong) May 1, 2015: 5:42 AM ET",

The Virgin Mary Church was torched and looted by a mob, some of whom chanted against Coptic Christians and called for Egypt to become an \"Islamic state,\" one of at least 42 churches and many more businesses and homes targeted that August, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch reports. Others attacked included St. George Church in Sohag, a city south of Cairo on the Nile River, and Prince Tadros Church in Fayoum, which is southwest of Cairo, according to reports. In addition to those getting life sentences, two minors were sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined 10,000 Egyptian pounds (about $1,300), Egypt's official Egynews reported. Most of those sentenced -- 52 of the 73 defendants -- were tried in absentia, with 21 already in prison, according to Egynews. Some blamed the church and other attacks on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement that backed Mohamed Morsy. Morsy became Egypt's first democratically elected president following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. Morsy was pushed out by Egypt's military. Morsy was sentenced to 20 years in prison earlier this month after being convicted on charges related to violence outside the presidential palace in December 2012. But he was acquitted of murder in the deaths of protesters. Journalist Sarah Sirgany reported from Cairo and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote this story from Atlanta. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> More from Middle East",

The question is: In preparing the monarchy for the future, has King Salman modernized the country? Saudi is typical for the Gulf -- by far the majority of its population is under 30 years old. But elsewhere in the region, younger leaders are increasingly the norm. Qatar is a point in case. The current Emir is just 35 years old, and his father was in his early 60s when he was ousted two years ago. And yet in Saudi Arabia, since the country's founder, Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, died in 1953, only his sons have been King -- passing the throne brother to brother, resulting an aging monarchy in an evermore youthful region. Now, the next in line to the throne are from the \"next\" generation: nephew and son of the King. That is significant and seems in line with Saudi Arabia's changing role in the region. The Arab Spring of 2011 saw the youthful Qataris get out ahead ofbigger neighbor Saudi Arabia, throwing money and influence at a multitude of causes. The Saudis were to a degree caught flat-footed, slow to respond to regional turmoil and protect their interests. But over the past couple of years the last King -- King Abdullah -- ramped up defense and security spending, setting the stage for a more muscular foreign policy. Under the new King and his two Crown Princes, Saudi Arabia has flexed that muscle in Yemen, with as many as 100 bombing sorties a day for over a month hitting Houthis and army units loyal to Yemen's ousted President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali al Khamenei was quick to criticize, targeting, what else, but age: \"Despite disputes, Saudis used to display composure with us, but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power and replaced composure with barbarism.\" That was early April before the recent reshuffle. So, far from recoiling at sharp barbs over youth, the Saudis seem to wear the criticism as a badge of honor. In a country where change happens so slowly, these new appointments, if not altogether unexpected, are a sign of a more outward looking future. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> More from World",

The agency switched course about three weeks later in 2010 after a physician working with Lubitz said his treatment was complete. That and other findings are revealed in documents obtained by CNN through a public records request that cover a time frame between April 2008 and July 2010 -- the period in which Lubitz was in Arizona training to be a pilot for Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings. Lubitz is accused of purposely slamming a Germanwings jetliner into the French Alps on March 24, killing all 150 people on board. He suffered from bouts of depression and the incident sparked a global debate over how to properly monitor the mental health of pilots. JUST WATCHED Reports: Cell phone video shows Germanwings' final moments 02:00 PLAY VIDEO OPINION: Germanwings co-pilot -- an accident waiting to happen? According to the documents, Lubitz suffered from \"reactive depression,\" which the medical examiner said was caused by \"modified living conditions\" and \"decompensation subsequent to excessive demands.\" Reactive depression can resolve itself when the individual recovers from an overwhelming event, according to Jacqueline Brunetti, who works as a medical examiner for commercial pilots. From January through October 2009, Lubitz received psychotherapeutic treatment, which included two medications for depression -- Cipralexone and Mirtazapine, both anti-depressants. \"The use of 2 drugs would suggest that maybe a single drug was not sufficiently effective,\" said Burnetti, who did not treat Lubitz, but said pairing anti-depressants could indicate an inability to \"cope with either day to day work and/or home demands.'\" It is not entirely clear when his depression began. But a document from April 2008 identifies Lubitz as medically fit to fly . Lufthansa CEO Carsten Sphor told reporters after the crash that Lubitz interrupted his training at some point in 2009. That break lasted several months. Medical documents do not reference that break or reveal why he took it. But it is clear from the documents that once treatment for his reactive depression was complete in October 2009, Lubitz applied to have his medical certificate and student pilot certificate renewed. Then, there is something of a mystery. On a June 14, 2010 questionnaire for a medical and student pilot certificate, Lubitz checked \"no\" when asked whether he presently or in the past experienced \"mental disorders of any sort; depression, anxiety, etc.\" There is another copy of the same questionnaire with the same June 14, 2010 date. But on this form, Lubitz checked \"yes.\" That second document indicated that the medical examiner modified the questionnaire to reflect Lubitz suffered from \"reactive depression\" from November 2008 through July 2009. Contacted by CNN, the FAA couldn't definitively explain the existence of the two questionnaires. Germanwings 'black box' shows co-pilot Andreas Lubitz sped up descent \"The questionnaire is done electronically,\" said Laura Brown, a spokesperson for the FAA. \"In some cases an airman may fill out the first page of the questionnaire before visiting with the doctor and once the doctor's visit is complete the form is updated,\" she said. She added that even after it's updated, the original form \"still lives in the system.\" When asked if they were aware of the existence of two conflicting medical documents, Germanwings Senior Vice President of Communications Joachim Shöttes said \"no\" and that they were \"unaware\" if both of the documents were submitted to the airline. \"I want to point out that the (First Officer) had been medically cleared to fly and hold all the requisite licenses,\" he said. Lubitz had not always been cleared to fly, however. A July 8, 2010 letter from the FAA's Aerospace Medical Certification Division informed Lubitz that after reviewing his medical examination results the FAA was \"unable to establish your eligibility to hold an airman medical certificate\" due to his history of \"reactive depression.\" Dr. Warren Silberman, who prepares FAA medical certifications, signed that letter and requested a detailed medical status report from Lubitz' prescribing physician detailing \"when medication(s) were discontinued and confirmation of no reoccurrence of the symptoms since discontinuing medication(s).\" In the letter, Silberman also requested \"a diagnosis, prognosis with medication(s) and follow-up plan\" before consideration of reinstating Lubitz medical certificate and student pilot certificate. The tortuous trail to 'Why?' In order to fly again, Lubitz would need his physician to vouch that he had successfully been treated and was no longer suffering from reactive depression. Lubitz' medical records show the medical specialist treating him wrote two letters saying Lubitz had successfully completed treatment. One was addressed to Lubitz and the other to an airline medical examiner, although the name of that person was redacted. That letter to the airline official states \"considerable remission has been obtained\" and \"medication has been tapered.\" It described Lubitz as being \"without memory disorders and phobias\" and \"mentally stable.\" After he was cleared by his psychotherapist, the FAA sent a new letter to Lubitz stating he was cleared to fly. That letter was also signed Silberman and it included that precautions must be taken in order for Lubitz to fly. \"You are cautioned to abide by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR's), Section 61.53, relating to physical deficiency. Because of your history of reactive depression, operation of aircraft is prohibited at any time new symptoms or adverse changes occur or any time medication and/or treatment is required,\" Silberman wrote. But Silberman says this is nothing more than a self-monitoring system. \"You don't see the airman with the number of cases so you have to rely on how good the letter is,\" he said. In other words, FAA certifiers don't see the actual airman. CNN was unable to reach Jörg Siedenburg, the aviation medical examiner listed in the documents as the physician Lubitz visited for clearance to fly. But the decision to approve or deny a pilot who was once deemed ineligible to fly is based on doctors' letters, Silberman said. And in his opinion, the letter Lubitz' physician provided \"was a very complete and legit letter.\" Silberman added: I \"had no reason to question its accuracy.\" Follow @CNNbrk Germanwings plane crashes in France 26 photos A recovery crew works among debris of Germanwings Flight 9525 at the crash site near Seyne-les-Alpes, France, on Friday, April 3.

Hide Caption Story highlights Next month's visit to Moscow by the North Korean leader is off This Victory Day marks the 70 years since the Soviet victory over Germany in World War II Moscow (CNN) Never mind. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has backed out of next month's visit to Moscow for World War II anniversary celebrations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. \"We were informed of the decision via diplomatic channels,\" Peskov said. \"The decision is connected with North Korean domestic affairs.\" The visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked Kim's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of North Korea in late 2011. He was to have met with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the May visit to coincide with Victory Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II . Kim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments, including the leaders of China, Cuba, India, Germany, Vietnam and Venezuela. This number represents about half the world leaders that Russia has said it invited to the celebrations. Kim's trip had been anticipated since late December, when Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation. There was no further explanation, from Moscow or Pyongyang, as to why he wouldn't head west. Still, North Korea has a number of issues it's been wrestling with for years. They include widespread poverty, its longstanding spat with neighboring South Korea and the United States, as well as its international isolation largely due to its controversial nuclear program. And news about Kim's non-visit comes a day after South Korean intelligence agents told lawmakers that Kim is ruling with an iron fist , having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year. CNN cannot independently confirm the executions detailed by Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy who attended the closed briefing. And the nature of the intelligence supporting the allegations was not immediately clear. That said, North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world. And there's little doubt that Kim is very much in charge. According to Shin, intelligence officials say the North Korean leader is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views that vary with his own. CNN's Madison Park and Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report. CNN's Matthew Chance reported from Moscow, and CNN's Ed Payne and Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta. Putin's Russia",

Thousands of football fans will descend on Germany's capital Berlin to witness two teams battling it out for UEFA Champions League glory on June 6 with the city estimated to rake in millions of dollars from the star-studded top flight football event, kicking off in the Olympiastadion -- the 77,000 seat venue that hosted FIFA's 2006 World Cup final. Souvenirs, accommodation, transport, food and beverage sales will contribute to the earnings of Germany's biggest city hosting the prestigious competition's 59th final, according to research by Onefootball and GoEuro.co.uk . \nThe trophy arrives at its final destination - Berlin City Hall #UCL #LegendaryMoments pic.twitter.com/gAiKi6576k — Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) April 29, 2015 June's festivities will only make up a fraction of the overall profit generated by the Champions League this season -- traveling fans have spent millions as they follow their teams around Europe, generating $261m of income for host cities. British clubs Chelsea, Arsenal and Man City could all have made an extra $1.4m for their respective cities if they had passed the final 16, whilst semifinalists Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have brought home $6m to their home towns.

Story highlights German police say they think they \"have thwarted an Islamist attack,\" interior minister for Hesse state says German terrorism researcher: Couple accused of planning bomb attack on bicycle race near Frankfurt (CNN) German police overnight thwarted a terrorist plot by a radicalized couple, a plan they suspect involved bombing a bicycle race near Frankfurt, a German terrorism researcher briefed by investigators told CNN on Thursday. German prosecutors and police said that a man and a woman had been arrested in the Frankfurt-area town of Oberursel on suspicion of planning a Boston-style attack, but the authorities did not explicitly reveal the target. The suspected target, according to Florian Flade, the terrorism researcher, was a race planned for Friday. The race loops around Eshborn and Frankfurt on May Day each year, attracting large crowds of spectators along the cycle route. Prosecutor Albrecht Schreiber said police recovered a pipe bomb ready to be used, 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition, a gun, the essential parts of a G-3 assault rifle and 3 liters of hydrogen peroxide, which becomes explosive at high concentrations and has been used in multiple terror plots in the West, including the 2005 London bombings. Earlier Thursday, Andreas Hemmes, a spokesman for the police of West Hesse, told CNN that the house and car of two individuals in Oberursel, in the forested hills west of Frankfurt, had been searched. As a result of what had been found, police had expanded their search along the L3004 road on the bike race route, Hemmes said. \"We suspect that there was a Salafist background,\" said Peter Beuth, the interior minister for Hesse, referring to ultra-fundamentalist interpretations of Islam. \"Police investigations at this stage indicate that we have thwarted an Islamist attack.\" Couple identified as being of Turkish descent Flade, a journalist at Die Welt and terrorism researcher who first broke the story of the police raids, told CNN that a German couple of Turkish descent -- Halil and Senay D. -- were under arrest. He said the couple had ties to radical Islamist circles in the Frankfurt area. Neither is suspected of having direct links to the leadership of a terrorist group. Last week German police observed Halil D. moving in and out of a small forest near where he was living. They suspect he was looking for a good place to hide a bomb along the bike race route, according to Flade. Flade said that according to German police documents, German police first became aware of the couple at the end of March when they went to a garden center near Frankfurt to purchase hydrogen peroxide. He said the store employee contacted police after becoming suspicious for several reasons. The first was that the woman was covered in a full veil. The second was that the couple claimed they wanted to buy hydrogen peroxide to clean their fish pond in their garden, but the amount they were ordering would have been enough to clean dozens of such ponds. Furthermore, after police thwarted a bomb plot by German extremists trained in the tribal areas of Pakistan to kill American servicemen in Germany in September 2007 with hydrogen peroxide-based bombs -- the so-called \"Sauerland\" plot -- German law had required such stores to report to police significant purchases of hydrogen peroxide. Surveillance in Spain According to Flade, after the tipoff, German investigators began trying to figure out who the couple were. All they had to go on was the surveillance footage. The woman was fully veiled and her male companion was blurry in the tape, so they did not immediately know who they were. But in early to mid-April they were able to identify them and start surveillance to investigate the couple's radical ties. According to Flade, German police established that the couple had recently traveled to Spain, where they met with members of Sharia4Spain, a radical pro-jihadist group linked to Al Muhajiroun in the United Kingdom. Spanish police had monitored the meeting in Spain. They also established that the couple had links to radicals who had gone to fight with AQIM, al Qaeda's North African affiliate And they found the couple were in contact with a young radical Islamist from Frankfurt who had gone to fight in Syria at the end of last year and was recently killed. The pipe bomb that was recovered by police appears to have similarities to devices built by Boston Marathon bombers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Flade said the device recovered near Frankfurt included nails as shrapnel. The Boston bombers downloaded instructions from a recipe in Inspire magazine, an online Engish language magazine put out by al Qaeda in Yemen, which has also been translated into German and other languages. In August 2013, the British security agency MI5 revealed to Parliament's intelligence and security committee that Inspire has been \"read by those involved in at least seven out of the 10 attacks planned within the UK since its first issue (in 2010). We judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these 10 attack plots.\" Elevated threat in Germany Like other European countries, Germany is grappling with an unprecedented terrorist threat because of the high number of its citizens who have traveled to Syria and Iraq. In recent years there has been growing concern over radicalization in Germany's large Turkish diaspora community. Travel to Syria is particularly easy for individuals of Turkish descent because Turkey is the entry point for most foreign fighters traveling to Syria. According to Flade, almost 700 Germans are believed to have traveled to Syria and Iraq, with up to 90% joining ISIS. One-third of these have returned to Germany and 70 to 80 have been killed in the fighting in Syria and Iraq. There has only been one fatal terrorist attack in Germany since 9/11 -- the shooting death of two U.S. airmen outside Frankfurt Airport by a lone-wolf radicalized Islamist in March 2011.

      "text": "By Sara Ashley O'Brien @saraashleyo Israel is known for its robust startup scene. But it's hard for U.S. investors to sift through all of them -- especially when many don't have a U.S. presence. \nSo a new Manhattan firm is plucking hot new Israeli startups and bringing them to New York for a six-month accelerator. \nICONYC Labs is the brainchild of Eyal Bino, an Israeli entrepreneur and investor who's been in New York for over a decade, and Arie Abecassis, a partner at DreamIt Ventures. \nTheir mission is twofold: Find the most promising early-stage Israeli startups and bring them to U.S. investors; and help Israeli startups break into the U.S. market, which is necessary to grow their global presence. \n\"In Israel, for every investor, you have 100 startups. Here, there's more investors,\" said Abecassis. \"The supply and demand dynamic is much more favorable to the Israeli entrepreneur.\" \nThe first cohort, which launched last week,includes five startups, which each get $20,000 in funding in exchange for \"common equity,\" which averages about 8%. \nFor six months, the startups will receive all the perks that typical accelerators provide -- business counsel, introductions to investors and mentors, and free coworking space at AlleyNYC . \n\"It's a rare channel for Israeli startups to become successful in the U.S.,\" said Bino. \nThe founders spent the past six months scouring Israel for tech talent. They met with 200 startups and narrowed it down to five, which went through roughly ten interviews with ICONYC. \n\"We're really trying to tap into [startups] in fast-moving industries in their infancy,\" added Bino. \"In all the cases, we're the first U.S.-based investors, which is significant.\" \nFor the first cohort, this included startups working in agricultural technology ( Flux ), healthcare ( Myndlift ) and e-commerce ( DandyLoop ). The ICONYC Labs team (left to right): Eyal Bino, Arie Abecassis, Sharon Mirsky \nAccording to Marc Michel, a managing partner at early-stage firm Metamorphic Ventures, ICONYC is offering a proposition that is \"hugely valuable\" to investors like him. \nMichel has invested in Israeli startups like TalkSpace and Switch but said he won't invest unless the startup has a U.S. presence. \n\"If you can't show proof of concept to the U.S., most won't invest,\" said Bino. \nBut Michel has also noticed that Israeli startups are sometimes offered less than ideal terms by Israeli investors. So it's beneficial for the startups to pitch to U.S. investors, who are hungry for talent. \n\"I'm fighting to back the best entrepreneurs,\" said Michel, who is also serving as one of ten strategic advisers to the ICONYC startups. \nICONYC sees itself as a strategic partner to the entrepreneurs. \n\"We're reframing their potential of the company,\" said Abecassis. \"By staying in Israel, their ability to find customers and partners is much more limited. We want to provide a platform where startups are able to grow their businesses in a more capital-efficient way.\" \nICONYC plans to bring on another cohort later this year, with up to ten new Israeli startups.",

      "text": "Senzati customizes Mercedes-Benz and VW vans for super-rich clients, including royals and heads of state. Special doors for the butler. Custom bathrooms. Multiple TV screens. \nIt's time to drop your preconceived ideas about Mom-friendly minivans. The ultra-rich are paying big bucks to get vans overhauled for high-end road tripping. \nGerman firms like Klassen and Brabus have been operating in the market for years. But a new British entrant, Senzati , recently got into it after sensing increased demand for bespoke vehicles. \n\"It's like building a super-yacht. Whatever you want, you can have,\" said Senzati founder Dave Clarke, who focuses on customizing Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen ( VLKPY ) vans. \nWithin three months of formally launching his small firm in February, Clarke said he shipped five customized luxury vans to customers in Malaysia, Indonesia and the U.K. His client list already includes royalty and heads of state. \nSenzati plans to ship 12 vans in 2015, but expects deliveries will quadruple over the next two years. \nRelated: 7 quirky luxury products for the super rich \nClarke said his vans have some distinctive features, including a \"hostess\" door. The electric door option allows a hostess or butler to move between a vehicle's driver compartment and the passenger area, much like an airline hostess on a private jet. When passengers want service, the hostess can pop in. When they want privacy, the door zips shut and the hostess is out of sight. This Senzati van includes a fridge and a \"hostess\" door between the driver and passenger compartments. \nSenzati also prides itself on slicing up and reconfiguring its van doors and seating to ensure passengers don't have to climb over one another to get to their seats. Clarke said it makes the traveling experience more dignified -- a big selling point. \nThese vans, which frequently include multiple TV screens and custom bathrooms, start at £209,000 ($322,500). \nRelated: Audi is making diesel out of water and air \nLarger rival firm Klassen, which crafts about 60 to 70 high-end vans a year, offers some slightly more affordable options starting around $170,000. But prices can go well over $3 million, depending on a client's demands. \nKlassen spokesperson Jana Baum said one client from Qatar paid €3 million ($3.3 million) to completely redesign the interior of a bus so it would look and feel like his apartment. \nBaum said the company has many Russian customers, but is experiencing growing demand from Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland. Senzati customized vans cost well over $300,000 each. \nCompetitor Brabus -- which ships roughly 25 custom vans a year -- has seen this niche segment grow by about 10% annually, according to company spokesperson Sven Dramm. \nLike Klassen, Brabus sells a large portion of its vans to Russians. And even the struggling Russian economy hasn't hurt sales, which have doubled over the past four years. \n\"The [weak] ruble is not very good for our business, but in the end [our clients] still have the money and can afford them,\" said Dramm. \nDemand from China has also been growing, he said. \nGenerally, most customers are businessmen who want offices on wheels that let them work while traveling. \nBut, apparently, it's not just about work. Many entourages include kids. \n\"Everybody wants a Playstation,\" said Baum from Klassen.",

Mission controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, confirmed the probe slammed into the surface of Mercury, as anticipated, at 3:26 p.m. EDT, NASA told CNN in an email. NASA earlier said the probe was expected to hit the surface at 8,750 miles per hour and to create an impact crater 52 feet (16 meters) in diameter. The crash wasn't visible from Earth because it occurred on the far side of Mercury. Messenger (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) was launched in 2004 and traveled more than 6½ years before it started circling Mercury on March 18, 2011. It was the first spacecraft to orbit the planet closest to the sun. It traveled about 5 billion miles -- a journey that included 15 trips around the sun. The spacecraft was healthy when it crashed, but was out of fuel . When scientists determined there was no way to save it, they held a briefing this month to celebrate the mission's success. \"For the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet Mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA headquarters in Washington. One of the mission's big findings: It sent back data indicating that ice in Mercury's shadowed polar regions , if spread over an area the size of Washington, would be more than two miles thick, NASA said. As the end neared, the probe sent back some final tweets thanking mission managers and counting down its final orbits. The Messenger mission is over, but scientists say they'll be busy for years studying data from the probe. And while the space probe won't be sending back anymore images, you can see Mercury with your own eyes. It's visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of May. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> Space news",

Hide Caption 15 of 15 EXPAND GALLERY That was nearly two years after the then 15-year-old Yousafzai, whom Taliban militants despised for her outspoken support of girls' right to an education, was shot as she was traveling home on a school bus. Authorities in Pakistan said the people involved in the attack were linked to the Pakistan Taliban and were taking orders from its leader, Mullah Fazlullah. In fact, the Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault against Yousafzai, whom they labeled \"a symbol of the infidels and obscenity\" for her activism, including a BBC blog documenting her harrowing experiences. It's not known if the men who directly attacked Yousafzai -- who was born in the Swat city of Mingora but has since moved to England -- were among those convicted and sentenced this week. Around the time of their arrest, Bajwa said that \"we were able to track down the entire gang,\" known as Shura. All of them are residents of Malakand, which is also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Yousafzai not only survived that attack, she went on to become an even more vocal and influential international activist. In fact, her efforts helped earn her the Nobel Peace Prize -- which she shared with India's Kailash Satyarthi -- last year.",
